0,"There's a certain breed of actor that thrives on character roles and rarely gets the opportunity to excel as a leading player. Among my favorites are Dennis Hopper, Bruce Dern and this film's principal player, Harry Dean Stanton. Hopper's most acclaimed role was probably that of the alcoholic, assistant basketball coach in ""Hoosiers""; Bruce Dern similarly turned in an Oscar nominated performance as a booze-addled old man on the trail of cashing in a million dollar sweepstakes ticket in ""Nebraska"". For Stanton, it's this film that will serve well as part of his legacy in a long and distinguished career. Interestingly, among all three actors I've watched dozens of TV and movie Westerns in which one or the other have appeared, usually as villains, and always acquitting themselves well before the end credits rolled.Stanton's character here begins as a mystery, wandering out of a desert in a fevered daze, and transformed into a mute for a good part of the movie until his past is slowly reawakened with the help of his brother (Dean Stockwell). Impatient viewers will have a problem with the pace of the movie because not much happens in the early going, and repeated attempts by Walt Henderson (Stockwell) to bring brother Travis (Stanton) out of his shell are unsuccessful. Through gradual exposition, we learn that Travis's past included a marriage and a young son, now being raised by Walt and his wife Anne (Aurore Cl√©ment). Where I have a little difficulty is the comparative ease in which Travis reestablishes a connection with seven year old son Hunter (Hunter Carson), and consequently, how easy it was for Hunter to decide that he wanted to traipse off with his biological father in a dubious search for his missing mother. Even more puzzling was the manner in which Travis and Hunter managed to track down Jane Henderson (Nastassja Kinski), happening to be in the right place at the right time to observe the woman making a bank deposit at a drive-in window. That sequence and the one that followed with Travis and Hunter giving chase seemed rather slapdash in execution, particularly since neither one of them had seen Jane in over four years, and the instant recognition (by Hunter no less) defied credibility in my estimation. What raises the bar for the film however occurs after Travis identifies his former wife as a peep show call girl, and anonymously identifies himself by virtue of relating their past history together to Jane, who initially identifies with his story in the abstract, but eventually realizes that she's speaking to Travis when details of the conversation can only relate to her own past life. The twist of the story meanwhile, is not one the viewer anticipates, as Travis doesn't desire to reconnect with Jane as a couple, but to satisfy a desire to reunite mother and son. Again, perhaps a dubious reconciliation given the circumstances of the family's break-up, but satisfying enough when we see the look of contented fulfillment on the face of Travis as he rides off after completing his mission. I can't say I really understand the entire dynamic of the family drama at the center of the story, but the picture makes a fascinating character study out of Travis and his search for reconciliation, even if he was working from a cold deck."
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed a majority of this movie. As the others stated, it's beautifully done, and the acting is superb. I enjoy ""road"" movies and slowly uncovering the pieces of this man's life as he goes through the journey of Texas and California. I mean the ""amnesia"" is not believable, but I'll set that aside. I liked the stark contrast between Travis and his brother. One, an irresponsible, selfish drifter-type, the other a responsible, caring man. And I thought the kid's acting was believable - the way Hunter processed the new idea of having his biological father in his life and potentially meeting his biological mother.However, I have a problem with the third act. At the end of the movie, it felt like the director wanted the audience to feel relieved and content that Hunter was reunited with his mother. And that we should empathize with Travis driving off into the distance, as he had fulfilled his duty. But I feel exactly the opposite. This is an unsettling ending.Neither of these people are fit to be parents or make life-altering decisions for anyone. They both need years of therapy before being left to their own devices. Some of the other commenters mentioned she was not emotionally stable to be a mother. Although true, I think they're slightly missing the point. Travis emotionally and physically abused this woman! Tied her to the stove?! Of course she needs some help recovering before this kid gets thrust upon her. And there's a couple of sick societal norms being thrust upon us here - that this woman would be quick to jump to being a mom to this kid. That the maternal instinct is just going to pop into place! And then, that it's acceptable that the father is no longer in the picture because he's going to go find himself or something. No, Travis is an immature excuse of a human being and this decision is garbage.Poor Hunter, ripped away from a stable home. I use the word stable because they seem to be emotionally, financially, and physically well-adjusted enough to raise a healthy kid. Not because they're a married couple with a house. Anyway, poor Hunter is in for a treat, all because his father needed to soothe his own conscience.And we're supposed to agree to this? Not me. However, with that being said, I still enjoyed this movie overall."
2,"I would say that Paris, Texas is not for everyone, but, truly, that can be said about every movie. But I will say this: fans of methodically paced, beautifully shot, existentially rooted, and purely experiential cinema will not be disappointed.Paris, Texas is virtually my favorite movie, and a movie that, whether you like it or not, will leave some impact on you. It is a journey, an experience, an odyssey.Yes, it is long. Yes, it is slow. Defined plot points? Please.But what this movie does do is place into the mind of it's lead character. Travis Henderson, an older man, gruff and worn out with age, wanders out of the Texas desert after missing from his family for four years. He is mute, and apparently unaware of who he is. His brother Walt finds him, and tries to rehabilitate him back into sanity. The film then covers Travis's journey to reconnect with a past which he has long since forgotten. He reunites with his son, his sister in-law, and eventually, in a scene which I tear up just thinking about, his wife.But that is all I will divulge about his wife. That is a scene which you really have to see to believe.While this film really doesn't rely on plot, it does have structure and tone. And what carries us through this mystical story is the unbelievably beautiful photography. We see the world as it should be seen: a starkly beautiful, but uncompromising, place. The use of color and motifs really makes this film a marvel to look at.And then we get to performances. Everyone's great, so I will focus on our two truly main characters. Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, a gentle, kind man, that, despite having personal demons, is a great fatherly figure (fine, maybe he isn't the best father...but there's no denying he left an impact on his son's life). And seeing Stanton bring this character to life in the most subtle and somber way possible is amazing. And then we have Natassja Kinski, who plays Jane, his wife. She doesn't show up until the third act, and 95% percent of her performance takes place in one room. But Kinski's portrayal of emotion...and her quiet, yet powerful demeanor...and the way she talks...god, it's unbelievable. Stanton and Kinski have some of the best chemistry ever, which is even more impressive considering they're never in the same room (see the movie...you'll understand). In the end, these two carry the movie on their backs, and do an amazing job doing it.You may not cry, but you will think about crying. You will think about all the sad moments in your life. And it will all be washed out of you by movie's end. Believe me, I know this from personal experience. This movie is almost therapeutic in the way. Because the story is healing our own souls at the same time as it is healing Travis's.So. What's more to say about Paris, Texas? It's a beautiful movie, one that relies on photography and performances to tell it's story, and a movie that portrays emotions on a master class level. And what do I mean by 'Anti-Romance'? It's not worth explaining here. See the movie, you'll understand."
3,"I first saw this film almost fifteen years ago and thought about almost nothing else for at least a month.  I have never seen a film before or since that presents the extremes of love, pain, and loss with such immediacy and ruthless candor.  Watching this film with openness, identifying with the characters, made me wince and writhe in sympathetic agony.  I didn't cry; rather, I was reminded of all the times I have wept in my life, and why.Perhaps each person person has a film -- usually a masterpiece -- which affects him or her so strongly that it is beyond description.  This is mine."
4,"Directed by cinematic lyricist Wim Wenders, ""Paris, Texas"" is a slow-burning masterpiece. Marked at first by stark, beautiful photography of the American Southwest, later by memorable dialogue and conversational intercourse, and lastly by sublime and emotionally involving character development, the film transcends the idea of an atmospheric mood piece to deliver an engrossing meditation on loneliness, alienation, family, and redemption.Character actor Harry Dean Stanton is fantastic in the lead role of Travis -- a man who had fallen into an emotional black hole and is then reunited with his brother (Dean Stockwell), who has been raising Travis' young son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), in an idyllic and loving suburban landscape with his foreign wife, Ann (Aurore Clement). As Travis slowly begins to grapple with his past and bond with his son, he soon realizes he must find his long, lost wife, Jane (an excellent and understated Nastassja Kinksi), whom he still deeply loves on some level, and abandoned their son years ago shortly after Travis went off the deep end.This all could've been the plot of Lifetime TV movie, but the European filmmaker's perspective on an all American slice of melodrama adds an undercurrent of intrigue in that you never know what these characters are going to do next. We soon find Travis practically abducting his son (who eagerly plays along) from his happy new family life to go on a trek to Houston to find Jane.The closing in scene in a Houston hotel where son and mother are reunited is one of the most fascinatingly rich scenes ever put on screen. Rarely does any one scene work to engage a viewer on so many levels: Firstly: There is a complex psychological framework that is set into place in the scenes prior between Stanton and Kinski in the peep show booth where she now works which are two of the most expertly photographed and brilliantly acted scenes I've ever witnessed. Travis has confessed all to his lost love, Jane, and she is clearly in dire straits. His attempt to reunite her with their son is both selfish (in that it is clearly not in the child's best interest to be raised by his emotionally troubled mother when he has loving foster parents waiting for him back home) and selfless, in that he truly feels his only way to repair the damage he has done is to leave after getting mother and son back together.Secondly: It is beautifully acted with Kinski's ghost-like entrance and young Hunter Carson's trepidation. Witness his hand slide across the wall looking for something to grip, and then his hands running through his hair before he finally decides to embrace her.Thirdly: It is exquisitely photographed. Earlier we see scenes of stark isolation as the child waits in the hotel room. Sofia Coppola later used a similar photographic technique in ""Lost in Translation"" to show how being alone in a big city and looking down from an anonymous hotel room window can be one of the loneliest things in the world.The final scene is both beautiful and emotional, and at the same time makes the viewer wonder, how will this all end? Yes, it is wonderful to see the child and mother reunite, but their new life could easily turn into an emotional hell because of the now absent Travis' misguided attempt at his own redemption.A film working on so many levels like this is best summed up in its own dialogue. In one scene where Travis is drunk and telling his son some family history, he essentially says that his father was more in love with an ""idea of her"" than with his actual mother. This is a fantastic movie for people more in love with the romantic ""idea of movies"" and their potential power as an art form than with any one movie in particular. As such, this ranks among the best I have ever seen."
5,"We live in times when many people think they can have their cake and eat it as well. And this is nowhere more true, it seems to me, than when there are children involved.Travis and Jane had a bad marriage. It was mostly his fault, but in truth they both showed signs of instability. When the big blow-up came, the shrapnel scattered far and wide. One such piece was in the form of their 4-year-old son, Hunter.Now, Hunter was lucky. Unlike his parents, who disappeared into obscurity, he ended up as the ""foster-child"" of Travis's brother and his wife. They were stable, happily married, and gave him a loving home. He was as content as a boy could be under the circumstances.Uh-oh, don't count your chickens, Hunter. Four years later, out of the festering sands of the Mojave desert and looking like some sort of moulting lizard, emerges Travis. He is heading for some obscure destination ¬ñ possibly his dusty plot at Paris, Texas, where he might have been considering spending the rest of his life growing tree tomatoes, or anything else far removed from the responsibilities of parenthood. Instead, he encounters civilisation, which contacts his brother. Somewhat against his will, Travis is reunited with the son whom he abandoned.Now, to give him his credit, Travis is a man who realises that he has made some serious mistakes. Had the rest of the movie been about how he confronted those mistakes and actually did something about them and then won back his son's love bit by bit I'd have given it 10 out of 10. The final shot could have been that touching scene when Hunter stops and Travis crosses the road and they go up the hill together. Fade out.But, no. Instead of doing that, he decides to atone for his mistakes by taking his now 7-year-old son away from his happy and stable new home, on a journey down to Houston to find his mother. Hunter is to be sacrificed for the sake of Travis's conscience.In spite of discovering that Jane is unmarried and working as a nightclub hostess (you could say, a prostitute), he leaves the boy with her and runs off. No doubt he is heading for that arid patch at Paris, Texas once again. Except this time he probably thinks he has at long last done something good in his life.I can't agree. One of the worst exhibitions of parental irresponsibility I have ever seen in a movie is when Travis gets his son to phone his foster parents to tell them he has left home. This, of course, is after putting them to a lot of needless worry wondering where he was.Poor Hunter. How long before she quits on him again? Or hits the bottle? Or, before he gets abused by one of her clients? Oh, but the music's great. And the acting. And Texas."
6,"This film is a classic in my opinion.  The story is very strongly influenced by its writer's, Sam Shepard, exploration of the human condition.  The film is not for everyone.  Wim Wenders paces the storyline accordingly to the psyche and struggle of the main character, and the concept of searching for answers to his natural state of mind by returning to the place of his conception is a well thought out and intriguing premise for this film.I have seen this film more than seven times, and love the slow pace because it allows me to be drawn into that world completely and really have the chance to get to know each character.  Recommended to anyone with an interest in psychology, cinematography, Sam Shepard's style of story-telling, and movies that walk to their own beat.  Natascha Kinski and Stanton are excellent.I give it 8 stars (9 if they would release it letterboxed on DVD)"
7,"Moody, slow, absorbing, you lose yourself in this 'love lost' and in many ways tragic story. This film was probably an early warning to us all of how life can easily overwhelm without us realising it. It is also virtually unique in the successful portrayal of a man who is deeply lost in his innermost thoughts that the outside world becomes almost a minutiae. Mr Stanton encapsulates this mood perfectly and this is probably his best performance ever. The most moving scene (and there are many) might be when he reviews some old cine film of his life (a normal happy love story which surely could not have gone wrong so badly)before he walked away from it all. I can't help but think this is a real life epistle which could be a marker for how life has overtaken the human race in the last 20 years."
8,"Also my second favourite film of 1984 after Amadeus. Paris, Texas is just wonderful. The movie looks beautiful, the scenery is stunning and the cinematography and editing are just textbook examples of how to photograph and edit a movie. There is also a haunting guitar score that adds to the emotion of this film, and a deeply moving and affecting story complete with a heart-rending confrontation. The pace is deliberately mannered, but that is not a bad thing at all, if anything it is a strength, and the script is beautifully written. The direction is also superb, while the film sees a rare leading role for Harry Dean Stanton and he is just a joy in this movie. In conclusion, Paris, Texas is a must-see, and I honestly think it is one of the best of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
9,"Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walks out of the South Texas desert in an almost catatonic state wearing a dusty suit and tie. A doctor finds and calls his brother Walt Henderson (Dean Stockwell) in L.A. who comes out to reunite with him after 4 years absence. Travis is fixated on going to Paris, Texas. One day, he and his wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski) disappeared and had left behind his son Hunter. Walt and his wife Anne (Aurore Cl√©ment) took Hunter in.Harry Dean Stanton and Dean Stockwell drive the film forward as it teases what this eventually is going. It's like walking in the desert with Travis. It is fascinating but one must surrender to it. The kid is quite good. The movie does turn into something even more compelling with Nastassja Kinski. However it is a long road to get there."
10,"Throughout the entirety of Paris, Texas's two-and-a-half-hour running time (and not one minute of it wasted), it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears, he's animalistic, not talking, motivated only by his strange, unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires, but there's always that wild, uncertain edge to his performance, so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character, as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle -- the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon, the story of his own conception, the falsity of a peep show, the million artificial lights of Los Angeles, and the obsession that gives the film its name, the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries, but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions, and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again, seeing his son end ex-wife embrace from a distance.Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways, someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images: he creates billboards, simulacra if there ever were any, and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house (his wife is notably French, tying in his obsessions to Travis's). We are presented with two quintessential American images: the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier, but both are illusions and both bring only suffering.All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris, Texas: the gorgeous cinematography, the note-perfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well, those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle, and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are, for the most part, films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris, Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly."
11,"We all know why this movie is great, but I have a problem with it, the last hour. It's all done, written and acted very well, but it's just too darn long. So long that about half way through I was no longer caught up in the drama but was just waiting for it to end. And what makes this even worse is that up until this point the movie had such a great flow and then it comes to a dead stop and drags for a very long time. It doesn't help that the shots go on for a very long time before cutting and that there's no music.The director and writer knew that the scene was going to feel like this and did it anyway. Many things could have been done to assuage this but they didn't do that. I get the temptation to show off the writing and the acting, but for me it ended up working against the movie and not for it. And a director could have done many things to get the same effect in much less time.Again, nothing bad, just too long at the end. Even the ambiguous ending was good. At first I didn't like it but then the more I thought about it the more I guessed what could likely happen.."
12,"I agree with many of the comments here about the photography and scenery of this movie. It can be breathtaking. Wim Winders camera-work with the Texas landscape and characters within the landscape is second to none. I was ecstatic when I saw Ry Cooder had done the music for Paris, Texas.However, I just couldn't get through the unrealistic plot and character situations of this movie. A guy has been missing for four years and his brother just takes him home and sets up a bed for him like he's been gone just a few hours or something. Doctor? Hospital? The doctor in the desert doesn't count. He then just takes his kid who was abandoned by him and his wife and takes him on a road trip to find his mother without telling the people who were decent enough to take care of the kid. He then finds out that the mother of his child is working as a stripper and decides to leave him with her. Kinski's character knew where her son was all these years but never contacted him- I don't see that as someone who loves her son that much. Overall, great camera-work, scenery, soundtrack, and acting but the plot twists in this movie just were too unbelievable."
13,"I felt so tired of all those comments saying how beautiful the photography is or, for those who havent enjoyed the film, how the photography isnt enough to sustain the whole silentness of the first 2/3 of the movie.It just sounds like a hollow praise for a hollow minded cute, blonde and gorgeous girl. In fact, it is an offense.For a director that first was inspired by images and then looked for stories to fill them and give them reasons to be released as films (he says this in a book). Wenders achieves his high technical and vision point concerning his way of thinking, not just film but life in this masterpiece.He had before discussed the production of images and how this affects our way of seeing and perceiving life. But in Paris, Texas the image, the landscapes really becomes a character, not just to give a good photography and make those 2 1/2 hours that the movie lasts oh!!, so beatiful to watch!!, or to make us get in its atmosphere... The landscapes are so important as the words, or actions, between the characters are, it really touches people surrounded by it, it influences some how their personalities. I mean, each photograme tries to bring this relation.It is beautiful how Wenders can build his caracters personalities, not by the way they think or act, but what impresses them, what visually interests them - like when Travis is watching not the airplane, but its shadow on the ground while it takes off.After all that, i can just say that the rest of the whole story is made by really beautiful, touching and delicate situations of a man's life trying to reorder the lost pieces from a puzzle.And, yes, the conversation between Travis and his ex-wife by the last half hour to the end is one of the most touching moments seen on the screen."
14,"The first time that I saw this movie, it didn't really have an impact on me. I think that this was because I wasn't giving it my full attention. But the few times that I have seen it since it has made deep impressions on me that only a few films have done. Harry Dean Stanton's performance should be ranked among the great performances of all time in the movies. He doesn't have to say much in the first half of the film but the expressions on his face tell us he is in pain, almost like his soul has been ripped from his body. But we only find out later the reason for this.(Spoilers) Travis (Stanton) we find is suffering from guilt and the pain of losing the things in life that he loved the most. Most men that have loved will see part of themselves in Travis' stories of how jealousy drove him to not let his wife out of his sight, but we don't take it as far as Travis, drink drove his jealousy to new heights. Even though some of his stories would appall us, now we have seen how he destroyed his life, or the drink destroyed him, we now feel sorry for him. The two monologues with Jane are, in my opinion, two scenes that will stay with every viewer for a long time. Travis cannot even look at Jane because it would cause him too much pain and break him even further. But before he leaves Jane he needs to tell her why he did the things to her that he did, only then could Travis find some peace and maybe regain a part of the soul that he lost.Like John Wayne in ""The Searchers"" Travis realises at the end of the film that he has to go and leave alone, that he ruined his chance of a happy life with Hunter and Jane, or he realised that he could never be happy with her, for the intense love that he felt for Jane would always bring jealousy and suspicion would that would always be at the front of his mind.The music also deserve a mention. The southern, bluesy slide guitar by Ry Cooder is so simple but so effective in adding to the lazy pace of the movie."
15,"Melancholic and reflective film, great performance by Nastassja Kinski, memorable soundtrack, with photographically beautiful and iconic scenes.The character Travis appears to have complex layers and an emotionally dense story, of an extremely traumatized man, victim of some unknown event, so painful he can't even discuss it, who loves his wife very much, and is trying to reconnect with his son.What could have led a man to abandon absolutely everything, to wander aimlessly for years and years?As the story unfolds, it is discovered that the wife is extremely young, only 17 or 18 years old, while he is over fifty, which adds a layer of discomfort to the story and a big red flag that something is very wrong, but let's keep watching.After the impactful and emblematic scene of the conversation with Jane, through the glass, we see Travis's true nature: a real prick.It could have been a story of redemption, after all, humans are complex, and we all make mistakes, but it's not.He kidnaps his son from a safe place, where there is love, education, a secure life, makes him lie, manipulates and betrays everyone. And for what? Just to feel minimally redeemed, only to abandon them once again, because he is a great ignoble, coward.It's two hours of him only worrying about himself, although he is being supported by his brother, who would have every reason to reject him.Travis, you're toxic male, with childish attitude. You should have stayed lost in the desert forever."
16,"It has nice stark images and a cool sound track .But Reality Check: The boy is being taken from the two people who have shown they love him, who are his real parents even if not his biological parents, and handed to a someone who is a stranger and clearly has serious issues about relationships of any sort. Sure she sends a sum of money at regular intervals but given that she has made no attempt to contact him for for years it clearly is not about real love. People who like the film talk about how it deals with loss, alienation and an inability to communicate. Fine. But why is it supposed to be a good thing to dump the boy into that nightmare? Just to sacrifice him on the altar of DNA?"
17,"This film is likely not going to please everyone, but I firmly believe that everyone should at least give it a try. I had very low expectations going in and I was absolutely blown away by just how amazing it was.Everything about this movie is pretty much perfect, to me at least. The cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the acting is some of the best acting I've ever seen in a dramatic film, the writing is on point, just everything about this movie is done incredibly well.The film is very raw and gives off a very documentary-like style. The characters find themselves in dirty, grimy settings. The mood of the setting is never overdone. When Travis enters the first booth in order to try and talk to Jane, another woman appears. It's an unpredictable film. There are no perfect situations, much like life itself. This is why I feel that the film gives off a documentary-like feel.Harry Dean Stanton cements his position as one of the most brilliant character actors with this performance. He's a man who's been through a lot, a man who wants to make up for lost time. He's been drifting around the desert for 4 years, and he wants to find perspective of his life again.Nastassja Kinski gives an equally brilliant performance. There's a certain segment in this movie where it's just a long take on her face while she's listening to Travis's story through the glass, and I thought it was one of the most impressive takes I've ever seen in a movie. The way she is able to convey so much deep yet subtle emotion with just her face is amazing. She doesn't need to suddenly burst out in tears. She's restraining herself, and not a beat is missed during the whole scene.The last 25 minutes of the movie, which include the climactic conversation between Travis and Jane, were some of the best final scenes in any movie I've ever seen, period. I'd venture so far as to say that the conversation itself is one of the most emotional scenes in the history of cinema.The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and it's one of the most deserved Palme d'Or wins of all time in my opinion. There were some truly great winners like Taxi Driver and The Tree of Life (controversial as that win may be), but Paris, Texas is one of the best.When Mark Kermode reviewed this movie, he said that the title of the film indicates a fusion between the European style of film and the American style of film. I thought about that comment, and it could not be more true. The director of this film (Wim Wenders) is German, and it appears that he used a lot of that dreamy European cinema influence in this film.The whole movie is virtually flawless. There are some people who will likely disagree with that, but it's a film that changed how I view the idea of cinema, and for that reason, it's in my top 5 films of all time."
18,"Harry Dean Stanton gives the performance of his life in this stunning and bleak journey into a mans soul and whats left when everything thats ever mattered is gone! yes it really is that desolate as stanton creates a feeling of utter  loneliness and reaches out to the audience with what can only be described as inner pain, as the film unfolds the story of how he came to be so alone and why he in fact wanted this isolation is told intelligently and sensitively, Natassa Kinski, is excellent in an understated role as stantons estranged lover, the  film  might  be  seen as a  downer  by  some  but  it  ends  in  hope  as stanton  faces  his demons, and the son that stanton had in his relationship with kinski is reunited with his mother, if this had been  made  in  the  usa  i  fear it would  have ended up  being a terribly corny affair, but wenders brilliant direction and the haunting soundtrack by rye cooder make it a must see for any leonard cohen devotee:)"
19,"I love Sam Shepard - have seen most of his plays and his films. He is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I love his acting as well - The Right Stuff was incredible. This film ""Paris Texas"" remains one of my all time favorites and his collaboration with Wim Wenders produced magic. Harry Dean Stanton moved from a character actor to a leading man with this. Just a masterpiece!"
20,"Wim Wenders's love for Americana propelled him to collaborate with famed playwright Sam Shepard and the result was the visually satisfying but inert drama, ""Paris, Texas."" The film's style (as noted in Wikipedia) include shots of ""old advertisement billboards, placards, graffiti, rusty iron carcasses, old railway lines, neon signs, and motels,"" to name a few. Many of Wenders's scenes here remind me of Edward Hopper paintings and despite the limitations of the film's narrative, it's well worth watching simply for the visual feast.The film's plot proceeds quite slowly. Walt Henderson is alerted that his brother, Travis, has been found dehydrated after walking in the South Texas desert. Walt drives from Los Angeles and picks Travis up, intending to return home to L.A., with his brother in tow. It's been four years since Travis disappeared and left his son Hunter to be raised by Walt and his wife, Anne. For quite a while, Travis is mute much to his brother's chagrin, who is desperate to find out where's he's been while missing. When Travis finally talks, all he can virtually talk about is a parcel of land he bought in Paris, Texas, where their parents allegedly met and conceived him.The second act‚Äîperhaps the most interesting part of the film‚Äîchronicles Travis's awkward attempts to bond with his son, Hunter, once he and Walt arrive back in L.A. Anne is upset that Walt is encouraging Travis to get close to Hunter, since she fears that he'll take the boy away. Actually, that's exactly what happens‚ÄîTravis asks Hunter if he would like to come with him to find his ex-wife, Jane, who had left the family since she could not cope raising Hunter. Travis and Hunter head to Houston where they bond on the way there. It should be noted that Hunter Carson did a fantastic job of playing his fictional counterpart, a role that required a great deal of nuance and sensitivity.If the two ""bonding"" stories (one between the two brothers and the other between father and son) prove to be fairly interesting, the film's resolution, unfortunately does not. A.A. Dowd writing in the ""A.V. Club,"" cogently notes what's wrong with the narrative: ""There's just something weirdly banal and unsatisfying about the explanation Wenders and Shepard belatedly supply. What drove Travis to abandon his family and flee for the freedom of Mexico? I'm afraid it's nothing more complicated than a case of run-of-the-mill relationship troubles, revealed during a very long monologue that places Travis on one side of a two-way mirror and his ex, Jane (Nastassja Kinski)‚Äînow dancing at a seedy Houston strip club to make ends meet‚Äîon the other.""""Run-of-the-mill"" explanations also apply to the film's title‚Äînone of the characters actually end up going to Paris, Texas and the Travis's story of his origins in that particular town, is hardly the stuff of high drama.Travis finally figures out that he's not cut out to be a father and abandons Hunter and Jane to fend for themselves. Presumably, Jane, will do the right thing and return Hunter to Walt and Anne, where he'll end up having a normal childhood.As ""Paris, Texas"" is considered one of Wenders's best films, one might conclude that he is a master of style but has difficulty in the ""substance"" department. ""Paris, Texas"" is well worth watching for the visuals but prepare yourself for a promising story that ultimately runs out of gas."
21,"Yes, the cinematography is very nice. Yes, Ry Cooder's slide guitar is compelling. Yes, the plot is simple minded, predictable and the characters have little in the way of depth. I saw this snoozer when it was first released, and even though the date I was with was stunning, I hated her for liking this simplistic tripe. Does anyone want to know why a babe like Kinski was involved with a geezer like Stanton? Why is everyone so ""shocked"" she works at a booth in a phone sex place? It's not like ""requiem for a dream"" exactly and is quite low on the shocking scale. And its long and dull - Wim Wenders seems to have forgotten that a movie can be edited. How this movie is anything more than a dull rumination on life is beyond me. Saw it on cable a year or so ago - it's still pretty, still sounds good and is still visual sominex."
22,"Presumed dead having gone missing over four years ago, Travis arrives in a small desert town ¬ñ thirsty and mute and passing out on the floor. A doctor identifies him and contacts Travis' brother, Walt, who makes the trip to collect his ""dead"" brother and bring him back home. Walt also brings bad news ¬ñ he has been raising Travis' son (Hunter) as his own since he was dumped on his doorstep by Travis' wife Jane ¬ñ who then just disappeared herself. Trying desperately to build a relationship with his son, Travis also decides to track down Jane and make his family whole again.Over the years this film seems to have grown in stature and reputation, partly because it is perhaps not as widely seen as it once was. For that reason I made sure I watched it when I got the chance recently and was struck immediately by one of the main reasons that I kept watching the film at times, that being the blend of beautiful visuals and haunting score. Normally films that have weak narrative will not suck me in but strong visual style (isn't that what the complaint about most summer blockbusters is?) however the striking look to the first parts of the film really drew me into it even when the plot did not. As everyone else in the world says, Ry Cooder's score was very well used and that's all I'll say on that issue since too many reviews seem to focus on this as if it were the most important part of the film.The plot is, lets be honest, very slowly delivered ¬ñ painfully slow at times; but yet it managed to fill almost 2¬Ω hours quite easily and surprised me by how it suddenly became an impressive film when, for large sections of it, I felt left out, disinterested and distracted. Of course many younger viewers may not make it that far because it is very slow at times and this will put many off before it gets better. It does build well and it is really with the scenes between Travis and Jane that the film is at its strongest; I'm sure others have different interpretations but I do like to think that Travis was dead and only returned to reunite his family ¬ñ whether dead to them or really dead is another matter but the ending was nicely low key and lacking the sickly sentiment that could have killed it. The cast are a big reason this works because many of them do play really well. Stanton is great and he does tend to steal the film from those around him ¬ñ whether mute or unseen behind mirrored glass. He is excellent in his scenes with Kinski, who more than holds her own in a smaller role. Stockwell is good in support and Carson turns in a likable performance that pretty much manages to avoid ""cute kid"" destruction.Overall this is not a perfect film and many viewers coming to it on the back of its reputation may struggle to stay with a plot that develops very slowly indeed without a great deal of explanation. The acting is good, the score is very well used while the direction and cinematography is close to mesmerising at times. The script does deliver but I was never totally into it until the final third; fortunately at this point things become much clearer and much more interesting and, despite taking an age to get anywhere, I was ultimately glad that I had watched it and had enjoyed the total film more than I had enjoyed individual moments of it."
23,"From the decade of blockbusters and popcorn movies, Paris, Texas (1984), winner of the Palme d'Or, is something else. Slow, long, depending on emotion, dialogue and characters, it gradually emerges as something worthwhile. Starting off in the Texan desert with a man picking up his brother, Travis, lost for four years and mute, the beginning to me seemed not so much intriguing as stiff, the performances a little unconvincing. Travis begins to talk and is reunited with his son, Hunter, who's now 7 and lives with his uncle Walt and aunt Anne. Hunter's mom, Jane, is still missing. Travis and Hunter get to know each other, with Anne concerned she and Walt will lose Hunter. Things are picking up as a family drama unfolds, and one gets the impression something extraordinary has happened.Surprisingly, Walt and Anne drop out of the picture with a lot of the film still to go, as Travis and Hunter return to Texas with a lead on where Jane is. Travis finds Jane in a sleazy place, where she ""talks"" with men. He tells their story, one of a happy marriage giving way to money woes, alcoholism, postpartum depression and abuse. Maybe it's not such an extraordinary story after all- but it's told in an extraordinary way. The look of Jane in that room with the two-way mirror is nearly surreal; that surreal side is reflected in the title. When you hear Paris, you don't think of Texas. But Paris, Texas is a real place, and there's realism in this film, too. This film gradually develops a sense of awe to it, and leaves its own distinct footprint."
24,"An unpredictable movie that opens with stunning cinematography and gives no hint as to where it's headed, ""Paris, Texas"" is the most unique movie I can remember. I think it's easier to describe feelings to someone rather than an actual plot; the need to reunite family at all cost, both with brothers and a man's household. I kept watching because the destination was truly a mystery, and it's one that just slams into you. No shocks, no violence, just an embrace. It's as hopeful as it is painful. It'd be an understatement to say that Harry Dean Stanton made this movie his own. And it's a clear reminder of the legend we've so recently lost. Here's to you, sir. 8/10"
25,"There is so much to say about this film that saying anything at all would undermine it. I haven't met anyone who wasn't proufoundly touched by the humanity director Wim Wenders and his amazing team captures. I'll go a step farther and say that this film is, to me, what America is all about; that is, the Johnny Cash kind of America of hidden pasts, broken hearts, and tiny moments of redemption. Wim Wenders obsession with the American West is apparent in the bleak cinematography and simple yet effective dialogue. A German doctor and French wife infuse a curious European mix that is markedly congrous with the universality of the story. I am madly in love with this film. You don't hear much about it except in certain independent film circles, but I believe it is one of the most effective English language films next to Citizen Kane and Midnight Cowboy."
26,"in 1984, Wim Wenders brought his European eyes to America's Los Angeles, and a modern masterpiece of a film was conjured from his many-nuanced observations. Through the character of Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) and his haunting tale of redemption, Wenders subtley explores themes of obsession, possesiveness, familial bonds and the ability of people to adapt to their circumstances and surroundings. Essentially a 'road movie', Travis's travels allow the audience a sense of the vast expanses of Los Angeles, captured and enhanced by the stunning cinematography and Ry Cooder's beautiful-but-minimal soundtrack. Wenders contrasts the cultures of the Spaniards, who once owned Los Angeles, with that of the European settlers in a poignant and sublime way; Travis's half-learnt Spanish heritage is no more apparent in his character than the obsessiveness he obviously inherited from his white father, the angst Walt and Anne develop concerning Hunter's future with Travis differs greatly from the practical advice a Spanish maid gives to Travis to 'fix' the problem - Wenders doesn't make a direct statement on the co-existence of these different cultures, but he certainly identifies and explores those differences. The entire cast is uniformly superb, Dean Stockwell and Harry Dean Stanton are a treat as always, but they shine no brighter than Kinski, Clement or Hunter Carson. And I haven't even really touched upon the mysterious story of the iconic Travis !"
27,"Wim Wenders was one of the doyens of New German Cinema in the 1970s. I first learned of him when my parents rented his ""Until the End of the World"" (my mom even bought a copy of the soundtrack). One of his most famous works is 1984's ""Paris, Texas"", winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival that year. Even understanding the plot, the movie is not easy to define. It's as though the movie itself is as vast as as the desert traversed by Harry Dean Stanton's character. One might interpret the movie as a search for life's overall meaning, whether in the swanky suburbs of Los Angeles or in a gritty peep show club in Houston. Indeed, the movie's length emphasizes the long time that it can take to achieve a goal.I don't know how much more I can say about the movie, except that no film buff can afford to miss it. A true classic (although I contend that ""Until the End of the World"" is Wenders's greatest)."
28,"Parts of this film reflect amazing cinematography, but the plot is disjointed and boring. There's really no need for anybody to see it. People who rate it highly focus on a few points (a few excellent shots) and try to give the story more respect than its writers did. It makes little sense and it's boring to boot. We go from a wandering amnesiac to some sort lost love story with pretensions of meaning. I can't stress how incoherent and unbelievable the plot is."
29,"Easily one of the most overrated movies of all time. Other reviews are somehow trying to set this up so that, if you don't like this movie, you somehow hate art and there has to be something wrong with you. No. Look under the surface. This movie is a mess underneath a shallow, calm surface, an accumulation of pretty much every clich√© in the book about the West. The ""minimalism"" only is a verneer on the bundle of romantic-cowboy clich√©s that is the protagonist, whose selfishness and callowness is somehow ascribed this massive moral weight and clarity. Wonderful. People confuse affectations of style for actually having something to say. This is a mechanistic, snobbish movie, almost wholly devoid of energy, grace, or value--but the fact that people somehow latch onto this as a kind of paragon of European-doing-America film making is, frankly, embarrassing."
30,"First of all i just want to say WOW,what a great movie. I,ve seen a lot of them and this one just blew my mind completely. The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar (it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard). And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this day(the performance is really captivating),as he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes out,and thats when the movie ""begins"" if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no name,no past,nothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brother(Dean Stockwell). The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this film,and you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LA,many things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember him(Hunter Carson),Stockwells wife(Aurore Clement in one of her best roles,i haven't seen her in much,and she deserves more,because she is a very good actor) and later,when they see film clips,we find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockingly,Stanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALL,is when Stanton finds The wife(Nastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece). There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computer,and the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is great,the cinematography,the acting,the soundtrack,the melancholic ""thing"" about it.It is really worth it."
31,"From the first minutes of ""Paris, Texas"" you realize that this film is a little different from the others of its kind. Starring Harry Dean Stanton as Travis Henderson, a man who suffered a nervous breakdown and estranged himself from his family as a result, the film is both a deep character study and an effective family drama in the same time.The movie begins with some beautiful images of the desert, vast and desolate. We are then introduced to Travis (Stanton) a man wandering through the desert for reasons unknown to the viewer. As he enters a bar, he collapses due to dehydration and is taken to a doctor by the bar owner. He is later reunited with his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), who came from California to his aid and had not seen him for 4 years. We know little about Travis' character and the fact that he initially refuses to speak to anyone only adds up to this mystery. As the story progresses, we slowly find out more about his background, we find out that he has a son named Hunter who is in the care of Walt and his wife, Ann (Aurore Clement).Harry Dean Stanton plays the main character and this is probably his best role. His best moment in the film is his conversation with Jane (Nastassja Kinski), a scene in which he showcases his whole talent. His performance is all the more impressive as he is supposed to express a full range of emotions in the beginning of the movie when his character is not speaking. I also thought that Nastassja Kinski was good in her role, despite the fact that she had quite a short amount of screen time.The film is character driven and we are interested in Travis' actions because we really care about him. Wim Wenders manages to direct the movie with precision and manages to keep the viewer connected. We want to find out why Travis wants to go to Paris, Texas, or why he was wandering through the desert in the first place. What I liked about this film is that you don't know how it's going to end, there are actually moments when you don't know what the main character is going to do next. This is probably the merit of writer Sam Shepard, who is probably better known to the public as an actor. I also found the movie's score to be great. Far from being very elaborate, it manages to bring the audience to where the action takes place. As a downside, the film might seem a little slow at times, but this is necessary for the build up.""Paris, Texas"" is an art-house film that presents a realistic story. I believe Wenders was just a little short of creating a masterpiece here. Nevertheless, this is a great movie and I think that it deserves more recognition.My rating: 8/10"
32,"My Rating : 8/10If you're still watching after 20 minutes and haven't become bored, you're going to be happy to have watched the movie till the end. For those who can't stand the slow pace and minimalist story its best to leave it alone.I loved the movie, it's extremely slow pace was refreshing to be honest - you need to be in a certain mood I suppose - the cinematography is gorgeous to look at too.Some emotional moments towards the end make for perfect drama according to me."
33,"Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas is one of the best movies that I have seen in along time, as well as being one of the most heartbreaking. The movie tells the extraordinary story about a man named Travis (played by Harry Dean Stanton who gives the finest performance of his career) who is nowhere to be found for 4 years until his brother Walter (played by Dean Stockwell) finds him and takes him home with back to Los Angeles where he encounters his sister in law Anne (played by Aurore Clement), and Travis's son Hunter (played by Hunter Carson). Then after a few days Travis and Hunter spend a lot of time together, and then start heading down to Texas to find Travis's wife and Hunter's mother Jane (played by Natassja Kinski).This movie is not only heartbreaking it is also heartwarming, the movie is one of the best road trip movies that I have seen in along time including Rain Man (1988), and Nebraska (2013, especially for that reason because of the wonderful screenplay by Sam Shepard. But in the end I really do think this movie is for everyone to watch depending if you really want to see it or not, it also depends on what type of genre you like for movies."
34,"Travis, a mysterious, nearly mute drifter, tries to reconnect with his young son, living with his brother in Los Angeles, and his missing wife coming soon on criterion 4k ultra hd release July."
35,"One of my favorite films. Great screenwriter (Sam Shepard), great director (Wim Wenders), great musician on the soundtrack (Ry Cooder). By turns a mystery, an adventure, a love story as well as one of the best renditions of the emergence of wisdom-within-relationship that I have ever seen. This film may take a bit of patience the first time one views it but, I assure you, that patience pays off. This kind of human depth is only achieved once in a blue moon in today's cultural landscape. Did I say that I recommend this movie? I think that, in particular, the combination of European and American perspectives makes for an especially fresh presentation of some classic themes."
36,"The film is about damaged self destructive people. Well made and acting spot on. There is no happiness in the film. Except for when Hunter is with his aunt and uncle. Hunter's reuniting with his biological father and mother is to his detriment. Both travis and Jane are damaged and a leopard cant change his spots. Seeing the end of the movie I feared for Hunter and hoped he would be returned to his uncle and aunt who offered hunter a stable home. But this depressing ending is what makes this film great because in real life there isn't always a happy ending and people remain damaged, self destructive, irresponsible, and degenerate despite their best intentions."
37,"""Paris, Texas"" is almost too beautiful for words - a sublime poem of love, loneliness, loss, alienation & redemption. Superbly acted by Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski, Hunter Carson, Aurore Clement and Dean Stockwell; written by Sam Shepard and L.M. Kit Carson, and directed by Wim Wenders (""Wings of Desire""), this is one of the best films of the 80's and, well, of all-time.Well-deserved winner of the Golden Palm at Cannes '84, the story of Travis Henderson (probably the best performance of Harry Dean Stanton's long, underrated career - the man's a real American treasure, yet is never mentioned in most Great Actors' list) and his little son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), as they hit the road looking for their ex-wife/mother (Nastassja Kinski), respectively, paints a picture of tortured lives in southwest America. The feeling of the very German Wenders's narrative, though, is universal. I'd compare it to the fantastic Taiwanese Ang Lee's vision of America in masterpieces such as ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"". Ry Cooder's score is also spotless and helps create the perfect mood for the story. A film to be seen over and over again. 10/10."
38,"A wonderful film that boasts a faultlessly atmospheric soundtrack and some of the most eye-catching cinematography you're sure to ever see in a film. Wim Wenders creates a fascinating story here about a purposeless man who is brought back into civilization and seeks to repair the mysterious problems of his past. Featuring a beautifully restrained performance by the late Harry Dean Stanton, this is a film that can quite simply change your perspective on life if you can find a way to totally give yourself to it."
39,"This film is slow, and so we have time to feel the privacy of the characters. The nicest scene for me is when the little boy go to his mother's arms. It is so simple and so strong, and so true! For me it's like if all the movie was a preparation for this moment. Great film, without useless things."
40,"What an intriguing drama. It was such a cool story. Everything makes sense. Maybe you won't agree with the end, but it is at least plausible. I love the twists and turns. I love that you didn't really know what was going on. These questions kept on growing until almost the very end. Great timing... Great acting... Can't say enough good things about this movie. Must see! So not what I thought I was going to see when I heard the title. It reminded me a bit of rain man at times, but the story is completely different. I guess I should say that rain-man reminded me of this movie. I almost also prefer the story line in Paris, Texas than in the rain-man (though I also loved the rain-man)."
41,The scene where Stanton walks his son to school is why I have children. The Scene where he goes into the phone booth to talk to his wife is why I will always love my wife.  Of the 864 movies I have seen in my life... this is the most profound.
42,"A man (Harry Dean Stanton) is found in the desert after four years.In case you were wondering, yes, there really is such a place as Paris, Texas, and it is a city of around 25,000 people. Why exactly Wim Wenders (or more accurately playwright Sam Shepard) chose it (besides the interesting name) is anyone's guess. Probably no reason in particular.It is interesting to see that this film seems to have had more influence on musicians than other filmmakers. Irish rock group U2 cite Paris, Texas as an inspiration for their album ""The Joshua Tree"". Scottish bands Travis and Texas both took their names from this film. And late musicians Kurt Cobain and Elliott Smith claimed this was their favorite movie of all time."
43,"Within the very first few minutes of this film you will witness bad acting and directing from the overly deliberate mechanized movements of each of the actors. Yes, the theme is beautiful but not the delivery and that's too bad."
44,"This movie is both very similar and very different to the other Wenders movie I've seen, Alice in den Stadten. The same dislocated, travelling emptiness is felt in a reporter sent to America and finding nothing to report on as a traumatized, nearly amnesiac Texan searching for redemption for his family. On the other hand, the worlds are completely different... the flatness and lack of deep fields in ""Alice"" are met with gorgeous pastiche of deep reds, blues, and greens in Paris, Texas. Indeed, in this latter movie, visuals sometimes overtake the narrative thread.Wenders certainly has a relationship with vagabond sensibilities that I really dig. In this movie, however, it is almost surprising to see the movie come to a narrative conclusion. Better than the surprise felt at actual closure is the 20 minute long reveal at the ending itself, which is just as satisfying and heartbreaking as the long build-up would bring the audience to expect. I could watch that ending over and over and over again, and it's been a long time since I've seen something so satisfying.--PolarisDiB"
45,"It's perfect in all ways and it's brilliant in all ways, Paris, Texas is a beautiful, realistic, depressing story, with a master performance by all the cast especially Harry Dean Stanton, Paris, Texas is just become one of my personal favorite and best films of all time, this movie is too good to be made."
46,"I shall be very generous and give this overrated movie 3 stars.I can't believe this movie won such awards.The reason I do so is because of the superb cinematography by Robby M√ºller. That, some nice dialogue, the mirror-sex concept and the beauty of Nastassja Kinski somehow made this film not a (complete)waste of time.The rest of the movie: mediocre acting, a childish plot, annoying and 2-dimensional characters, without anything symbolic and that awful scratchy guitar music...Don't waste your time on this one."
47,"'Paris, Texas' is a slow, subtle, dark and moody film that deals with love, forgiveness and redemption. It starts off with some stunning desert images where a Harry Dean Stanton wanders around until he is found by his brother. The enigmatic soundtrack stays in tune with the situations. The cinematography adds a spacious but lonely feel. Harry Dean Stanton, Dean Stockwell and Natassja Kinski are exceptional performers. They all excelletnly downplay their parts. The film starts off with little dialogue but as the goings-on proceed, the dialogues/monologues more or less take over and become stronger as they reveal a starkness of the characters' inner thoughts. This is especially beautifully captured in the later scenes between Stanton and Kinski. 'Paris, Texas' is also intricately layered and I am sure to discover more things with each repeat viewing. Sheperd's writing is wonderful as he weaves complex themes into the story and memerizes the viewer. In a nutshell, 'Paris, Texas' is a haunting and powerful picture that, once it captivates the audience, it lingers in mind long after the closing credits have rolled."

49,"""Paris, Texas"" is a co-production between West Germany, France and the UK from the year I was born. The language is mostly English. At approximately 2.5 hours, slightly under, it is a really long film. One of the three writers here is Sam Shepard, a very prolific actor himself, and actually this movie is from the year when he scored his one and only Oscar nomination, so you could say that he was maybe at his creative peak there. The script is not by Wim Wenders, the man who is considered one of the finest German filmmakers of all time and luckily he is still alive and I got to see him in person a few years ago on the occasion of one of his newest movies. He also was very prolific of course when it comes to documentaries, but this movie we have here is a definite contender for his most known live action movie, even if I must say it is not my favorite from him. As you can see from my rating perhaps too. But that is just because some of the other stuff he came up with is so good and not because this one here is bad or anything. It definitely is not. Nonetheless I would say that the awards attention, namely a BAFTA win, a unanimous Palme d'Or and the big prize at the German Film Awards that year were a bit too much, just like the fact that it is still listed in the imdb top250 highest-rated movies at that point, even if it is very low on said list, so could fall out in 2021 or 2022 perhaps.The Golden Globe nomination was for Foreign Film obviously, but at the Oscars of course it did not get in, was not even selected by West Germany because, like I said early on, the film is in the English language. And not just the name of the director is a pretty famous one here, but also some of the names and faces from the cast will seem familiar. The one lead actor here is Harry Dean Stanton, who was probably older already than he looked when he made this movie and died not too long at a relatively ancient age. But he left us another western to say farewell and that one is pretty good too, just like this one here. Can you call this film a western? I don't know. Sometimes it seemed to me this way, especially the desert scenes very early on, but I can also see why people would say it is a drama, family drama probably, just like it is declared here on imdb. It's not too important anyway what it is. As long as it's good. And that it is. So yeah, Stanton does a good job, but a lot of his performance is very quiet, very subtle, not only becaue he is not talking at all in the first 30 minutes or even more. Stockwell plays his brother and he is still alive today and Cl√©ment plays the latter's wife and so is she, but she is not that old anyway, so no big surprise, but still nice. I actually liked how they acted towards the protagonist and how they treated him, also the small gestures. Of course, she was scared of losing her ""son"" to him, but she did her best to not make it too obvious. And it came pretty easy because she liked him too, even if he was just extended family.The child actor here is played by Hunter Carson, who has the same first name like his character and I think that is nothing too uncommon for Wenders, but I will get to that later on. The late Bernhard Wicki has a nice little cameo early on that brought more comedy than I expected and I also did not really expect him to be in this movie, but I am still glad he is in it and he was a welcome inclusion. And finally Nastassja Kinski: She has a lot of screen time in the last third of the movie. I read that some thought her portrayal was iconic even (many still think so today), but I would not go that far. Still she was very commanding and gave a great performance and definitely stole the last 40 minutes, even if admittedly Stanton had absolutely no material there to be on equal terms with her. It's all about her there. And she is very good. A bit of a pity that she could not deliver the exact same way many more times in her long career. After seeing her here, her talent is undeniable. She plays the mother of the boy I just mentioned. This surprised me a bit I must say because she seemed way too young at first to have a kid that is almost ten, so I thought she was just another character, but no she is indeed the mother. I thought maybe the first blonde woman could be the mother, but the protagonist was just disappointed what she had turned into and that is why he kept moving forward to find the mesmerizing character played by Kinski. Of course, that also means quite something if I say it as somebody who is not really too much into blondes.One thing you need to pay attention to is the use of the color red in the last third of the movie, not only, but most of all when it comes to clothing. However, there are also smaller examples of striking red like for example the telephone. Or the car of course. Cars I could say. Actually, I felt that maybe they were following the wrong car when a second red car showed up, but I should have trusted the boy. Clearly he knew what he was doing. My bad. In terms of him and how he goes on a road trip with his father in the second half, I immediately had to think of ""Alice in the Cities"". Wenders clearly loved the idea of a grown man travelling around with a child in order to have said child reunited with his parents. But the good thing is that it never felt repetitive, so all is fine. I also liked to watch how he grows closer with his father. And how it all happens relatively undramatic. Like there is no huge emotional turmoil for the son. Like there is for his uncle's wife. The son says on one occasion even that he has two dads now when he talks to his friend from school. And how he eventually does walk home with his father after the initial struggles and how he calls him ""dad"" after watching the old video with his parents I think was downright sweet. The uncle was also a bit more relaxed than his wife, but hey it makes sense. Women are often more emotional.One thing I must say is that this film was heading into a completely different direction than I expected early on when we have these scenes with the mute man in the desert. I would not say I had any idea really which directions it could be going for, but what happened and what paths Wenders was going on I did not expect. As for the muteness and the sound of voices, this is a very crucial component here: Early on, our ""hero"" would not talk at all and at the end when he is talking to his former partner, he initially has nothing but his voice to keep her in the room as initially she does not see him, only hear him and yet she does not recognize him because, like she said, she heard his voice in every man. But yeah, that was really impressive framework there that made quite an impact in my opinion and not too many paid attention I have a feeling. The development and transformation of Harry Dean Stanton's character. Of course, as always with Wenders, there is also a pretty unique of subtle (and sweet) comedy to his movies. Nothing in your face. The exact opposite in fact, but still it just gets audiences in really good spirits and makes you feel a bit warm inside your chest. The reunion of mother and son is of course also very touching at the end and Wenders sure knows how to come up with happy endings that also feel pretty authentic and not just for the sake of making audiences feel good while losing realism and authenticity in the process. Not the case here luckily. This film surely felt shorter than it actually was and for 150-minute movies (or almost), this is always a good sign. Nicely done from everybody involved.The criticisms I have here are just minor really, here and there a scene I did not like that much or that did not feel too realistic, but maybe that is also at least partially subjective. One example would be how HDS's character falls asleep inside the car with his boy calling him to follow the red car. That was a bit absurd maybe. But yeah, difficult to come up with real flaws here. Wenders' films are always nicely atmospheric and have also really good music. This one is no exception. Honestly, the western elements early on made me wish for Wenders to do a 100% western movie (like the old ones with Eastwood etc.), but I'm afraid this will never become reality. Oh yeah, I had this film on my watch list for a long, long time, so I am happy that I got lucky to see this film on the big screen yesterday on the occasion of Wenders' 75th birthday not too long ago. If you get the chance, I recommend you to take it as well. certainly better than to see this film on a small laptop or television screen. Anyway, finally I will create a frame as well because the title confused me a bit and I always kinda thought that it would include a journey from the French capital to Texas, but of course I was really wrong as the comma should have told me anyway. I give this film a thumbs-up overall, even though not a truly enthusiastic one. But it is a good watch and I suggest you go check it out."
50,"Nothing to see here, friends. Maybe I am lacking something here and the fault lies with me and not the film. After all, people are crazy about this film. For me it was two hours and twenty minutes that went nowhere in particular. Don't see how anyone can give a darn about the characters in this film. Still don't know what Travis was doing for four years or how he lost his memory. Don't see what there is to praise in this film. For me it was a colossal bore."
51,"SPOILER WARNING The movie was often engaging, but there were times I wanted to fast-forward through the seemingly endless pregnant pauses. And then, after establishing the depth of love and committment to Hunter that Travis' brother and sister-in-law had for the boy, the story abandoned the couple in favor of Travis' drawn out, moon-eyed angst. Also, it was never established that Hunter's mum was in any way prepared to regain custody of her son. Hunter had already come to love his foster parents, and they, he. What about the emotional trauma of suddenly ending that relationship? We haven't a clue, because the writer/director didn't think it was necessary to resolve the issue. I'll give it this; it's one of those movies where one truly feels they've gotten their money's worth: it seemed longer'n a Baptist sermon in June."
52,"Paris, Texas is like a flowing river of life. I didn't want the film to end. It encompasses everything from the love of a child, departures, loves, to life's philosophy. The film takes you on a captivating journey through various emotions and experiences. It beautifully portrays the complexities of human relationships and the profound impact of our choices. ""Paris, Texas"" is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves a lasting impression, making you contemplate the intricacies of life long after the credits roll.""Paris, Texas"" is an exquisite cinematic experience, skillfully crafted to evoke a myriad of emotions from its audience. It takes us on an intimate journey of self-realization, human relationships, and the everlasting impact of our choices. Wim Wenders' masterful direction, combined with outstanding performances and a touching score, makes this film a truly unforgettable and cherished gem in the world of cinema."
53,"""Every man has your voice."" 'Paris, Texas' is one of the best art-house westerns out there. A slow-burn two-and-a-half-hour movie that kept my eyes locked onto the screen. How a movie can be so warm, and gentle hit the hardest in emotions. The movie is long and slow paced, so of course it's not going to be for everyone, but then again, every movie isn't for everyone."
54,"""Paris, Texas"" is just a word game. The Paris of Texas is not the Paris of romance, it's just a bare field.But for Travis, it means a lot: it's where his parents first had sex -- the source of his existence; It was the place he had bought with Jane, and he even wanted to live there with her. The loneliness and desolation of the barren land reflect Travis' extreme loneliness.After saying goodbye to his family, Travis is sure to look for this place again, after all, this is where his soul resides.
The loneliness and depth of the movie hit my soul. Forever alone, I'm afraid I'm Travis, afraid I'll be alone forever."
55,"A drama that deals with the exploration of the protagonist's confrontation of facing his family issues. The film fails, due to the film being depended on comedic moments. Personally, I did not find the film funny. Therefore, I could not connect with the film. On the plus side, the film's cinematography is gorgeous. At times, it looks like the cinematography was done by Soderberg in the late 90's. Simply gorgeous. Across the board, the acting is excellent. Despite not liking the film, the scene in Houston is astounding. In short, this movie would of been great if the comedy deliver or if it would been less quirky. Besides these two major problems, it is a well crafted film."
56,"It's two hours and a half, but it doesn't feel like it. A story about loss and grief due to the end of a relationship, but also about forgiveness. There is a smart use of color that helps convey the overall mood of the film. I certainly recommend it and I will watch it again."
57,"I watched Paris, Texas on TCM recently. I noticed that it was highly rated and so I figured I'd give it a try. I think I can safely say that it is not a fast-moving film. There are no gunshots or car chases. There are few angry voices. It is the simply story of a down-and-out man trying to create a little good in the world he once lived.If I have a complaint about the movie is that it is about one chapter in the life of an ordinary man. Hence, a fairly long movie that is slow-moving movie with no gunshots or car chases. Not exactly boring, but not edge-of-the-seat exciting. The good part is that it was well acted with good cinematography. If you want a leisurely film featuring a snippet of life, Paris, Texas might be for you."
58,"It is by this film that I discovered Wim Wenders is filmography and learned to appreciate the immense character actor that is Harry Dean Stanton which is quite funny since he plays the leading role in this Palme d'or.I couldn't ask more than this movie, it proposes an in-depth analysis of relationships (Father-Son, Brother-Brother, Husband-Wife) in a realistic and touching way while taking maximum profit of complex acting performances and simple yet effective directingThere is nothing less or more to say about Paris, Texas. It is a movie that can't be described traditionally, you need to see it to feel it."
59,"Paris Texas (1984)
9/10
Man that quit life returns after fours years of exile in desert tries to reconnect with his young son and ex-wife.Setting of southwest US lovingly captured in all its sun faded glory. Rugged expanse of the desert landscape, dilapidated roadside motels, psychedelic neon at dusk. Score is simple and evocative, twang of a lonely slide guitar rolls and lingers in the background like tumbleweeds.Harry Dean Stanton, who is the lead actor as the father, put in a very impressively understated performance. Effortlessly channeling wide range of emotion ranging from being a mute husk, hopeful sheepishness, nostalgic longing, pained regrets, and silent rage of jealousy. All other supporting actors are also good. Child actor deserves special shout for very natural performance in a tricky role.The mystery of the father's past drives the plot in the first half of the movie. For what compels a parent to do the unconscionable? What sort of demons were they running from? You start seeing glimpses of humanity as he starts to reacclimate to civilization. Then memories starts to return; the past hurt that had rendered him mute slowly bubbles up to the surface. Culminating in a final reunion that reveals the origin of the split. It speaks to the depth of character development that by the end of the movie, that you could at least acknowledge his pain, if not sympathize with the deadbeat dad (but probably still not). What's surprising to me is how the movie was able to resonate deeply without resorting to melodrama, outburst of tears, and catharsis of simple redemption. Instead, a quiet melancholy permeates most scenes; punctuated only by some of the most achingly tender scenes as the estranged kid warms up to his birth father.Must watch if you want a moody slow sad Americana tragedy. Also if you are interested in seeing use of ONE WAY MIRROR AS METAPHOR FOR EMOTIONAL DISTANCE."
60,"One of the most touching films,with exceptional music
by Ry Cooder.Basically a road trip film with tons of emotions
and unforgettable scenes."
61,The screenplay delivers a heartbreaking scenario and it manages to take fantastic sequences with an astonishing twist.
62,"You watch a movie, it bores the crap out of you, and so you go check it out on your favorite websight to see what might have possesed so many other people to praise it so highly.  After reading a dozen or so reviews (see above), you realize that everybody liked the movie for the same reason that you hated it. Because it is boring, plotless, and nothing whatsoever happens thoughout the 2+ hour film.  The only difference between you and the others is that they have used words like ""stark""  and  ""minimalistic"" to describe it, and they explain away the fact that nothing really happens during large chunks of the movie by calling it a study of uncommunicative behavior, or claiming that the setting is the real protagonist in the movie.  Maybe I am a dunce, but I think it is a waste of time."
63,"Look, I'm a 23 year old with no kids or wife. The acting by dean was superb. The story was actually pretty good and the director did a phenomenal job. A lot of good shots and engrossing scenes but my complaint was I couldn't connect with it on the level I feel I should. Dean definitely tried his best and I wanted to be but I just felt a little less emotional about this film than some of the other viewers. Also maybe a good 10 or 15 min shorter probably would have been better"
64,"The film is a deconstruction of the lies and fakes that human lives are built upon, functioning either as a compromise, or a compensation for their unresolved feeling of emptiness. There are several patterns of rehearsal and simulation in ""Texas, Paris"". To begin with, the very title gives the first hint and synthesis of imitation in the story. The original Paris, the idea and mirage the characters dream to live up to, confronted with the sadness and vacuum involved by the impossibility to recreate it. The characters are too absorbed in their incapacity to make their dramas intelligible to themselves and, therefore, too conflicted to be authentic in the hypostasis they are supposed to embrace. Consequently, they mime roles and concepts instead of accessing and revaluing their emotional potential within themselves. The fake family of Walt, Anne and Hunter, for instance. The two grown-ups are playing the parents instead of becoming biological parents themselves. Anne's despair in seeing Travis and Hunter, the real father and son, growing close, as well as her rhetorically articulated fear of what might happen to her marriage should Hunter join his real parents, could also be interpreted as a tentative of escapism from the problems and disconnections within the couple. A ""borrowed"" child and the picture of the dream-family living tranquilly in the suburbs might very well have worked as Prozac for the couple, since both of them seem to lack the inner instruments and resources to define themselves and their feelings in relation to each other in a marital context and build their marriage on real, solid grounds. When accusing her husband of ""promoting the father and son business"", she objectifies a highly humane, delicate and heart-felt subject approaching it in the cold terms of PR and soap-opera, which highlights the extent of her emotional numbness and self-alienation once more. She is more or less in the banner business together with her spouse. Certainly, Walt's particular line of work with banners is not an accident in the movie, but carries the same symbolical connotations of clich√©s unanimously accepted and imposed as reality. Travis buys a lot named Paris, hoping to settle down there with the woman he loves, but his real-life sentimental paraphrasing of the city of love ends up in a domestic ordeal, abandon and, eventually, loneliness. Having returned to his son, he doesn't know how to behave with him, wondering how a ""Father"" normally relates to his child. He tries on the ""rich father"" role, suit and hat involved, because he has no affective notion and practice of parenthood, at first. Then, when the father and son are walking on two parallel sides of the road on the way back home, Travis mocking his own clumsy father figure morgue and Hunter imitating him, we finally see the two of them in tune with each other, slowly growing out of the stern roles and pretense in their lives and coming to an emotional and authentic reconnection through game, humor and sound self-parody. From that point on, as the story progresses, Hunter undresses himself of his self-perception and experience as Walt's and Anne's surrogate son. The quick, amazing familiarization with each other leaves the viewer with the impression that there had always been a deep father and son complicity that was interrupted and now restored, put back in its rights, as Travis went back being his son's reference point on that street. Heart-broken after their romantic failure, Jane leaves her son in safer hands and reconstructs her particular connection with Travis in her imagination, since their relationship had become too self-destructive to be continued in real-life. Since her mind is no longer able to recreate her lost love's voice and features, she takes a job that consists of entertaining men whom she can't see behind a wall-mirror, identifying their voices with Travis's, and perhaps even hoping he was among them. She, too, elaborates her own substitute for her irreplaceable and impossible romance in a room that is essentially a pretense of intimacy and connection. The wall-mirror is a metaphorical separator of globular lives that can't find peace and a sense of fulfillment within themselves before opening up to one another, held captive within the tragic narcissism of their unhealed obsessions. Bottom line, the movie shows us a very realistic bunch of existentially disoriented people having their lives reduced to a void, striving to deny their sadness while manufacturing surrogates and more tolerable versions of their condition. Personally, I noticed some similarities between Wim Wenders and Jim Jarmusch as far as their theoretical approach on the human condition, loneliness and absurd are concerned. However, while Jarmusch leaves his characters in the uttermost meaninglessness and entropic alienation, this state is only the beginning of the characters' quest for truth and connection in Wenders's far more tender film, making the passage from fake and artificial postures to self-confrontation and blunt honesty, love and, eventually, some melancholic form of togetherness."
65,"Paris, Texas is a unique movie. Anyone watching it will have a hard time forgetting it. It mostly stands out because of its characters. They have real, relatable feelings that come through thanks to the great performances, in particular by Harry Dean Stanton who easily steals the show as a tragic figure and the pleasant surprise that is Hunter Carson, the realistic dialogue, the setting and the use of colour. The way the plot unfolds is also engaging and unpredictable. It's essentially four movies in one.The first establishes the main character and the mystery that surrounds him in a captivating way that keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat. Travis is all alone in the middle of nowhere and he is purposelessly walking in the striking, bleak landscape. His brother Walt picks him up but the long way home provides little to no comfort, it seems that there's no place in this world for him.The second shows him reunite with his son Hunter and explores the family dynamics of a kid with two fathers, as Walt had been raising Hunter as if he were his own son during Travis' absence. It's especially touching when they watch a 5-year old they are reminded what a loving family they had - and lost.The third returns to road movie style, as Travis and Hunter start a quest to trace Jane, which leads to the fourth, the climax of it all. It's the final showdown between Travis and Jane and with it they confront the ghosts of the past in search for redemption and forgiveness."
66,"This cinematically stark West Texas landscape contains a soul-searching, existential odyssey of one man and his search for the meaning of life and re-connection with family. Sad, depressive encounters, and resignation redefine his once high expectations.Strong performances by all actors, (including a remarkable young boy), keep the interest high throughout, and inspire a desire to know everything about their character's lives. This is a tour de force for its European director, Wim Wenders, and other foreign cast and crew members. Unusual for its time, in that a European crew came to one of the bleakest areas of the United States to produce a film, instead of the more typical American film being shot on location overseas."
67,"The film is not bad and has something legitimate to say but it's just a grind to get through for me. A man who was missing for four years is found and his brother is called up to go grab him. His brother and his wife have actually been watching the man's son because the man's wife went missing around the same time. Eventually the man reunites with his son and goes to find the mom and facilitate that reunion as well. The part that is beautiful is the son who was about eight when reunited didn't care about what either of them were doing he was just glad to see them. That's a child's heart being able to forgive and love still when everything went sour. I could relate to some of the feelings of the main character (Travis) but I can't picture a world where I abandon my kids for four years. A week or two work trip is hard enough for me. My wife and I have had plenty of ups and downs but understanding that part is like impossible to me. The acting of the movie isn't bad, I just rate it so low because it's a slog."
68,"A 2001 beautiful desert scene as the start features the Wandering Man dressed in a City Slicking suit with a suitably intelligent tool, a bottle of water.The Established Brother starts the film with the aspects of the establishment, a wife, a caring wife, a house, a car, an adopted child, a business. He ends the film in the same established position. Unmoved by his often-careless, restless brother's plight.The film is a beautiful view of Texas, the US and the planet. It features no violence, no murder, no mutilation.Sexually it is interesting to see Kinski in a participatory voyeuristic sexual setting mirrored thesedays a URL away. Not much has changed. When mankind conquers Star Trek style a distant planet, assumedly it'll appear not to have changed then either; looking at a carbon-based life's planet's desert it's difficult to see prosperity and life.The Young Lady in her Twenties is seen clearly only in the present tense in artificial light. The continuity cuts to night when The Absent Father, with a toy horses head illusionally up his rectum, a note to later when he encounters a lady dressed up in a nurses uniform wearing an inflatable horse around her waist, tells The Child that informing his family of his whereabouts will stop them worrying.The view of Kinski, quill-like, her world upturned and this time gracious to her past nemesis for providing to her her child. Knelt down in front of him while he's abandoning her again himself unable to meet his own expectations, his rocky, still face present. This image is lingering.Ry Cooders music is innately apt.The shown image of a quiet, neon-lit, tumbleweed American town night is echoed rarely, for instance in Jarmuch's Night Train, and Lynch & Frost's Twin Peaks the TV series.Travis has already survived before the film starts. He experiences a intra-US road trip with his brother, and another with his son, √† la Persig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintennance. Yet he communicates at length, the culmination of a story after a story with no guarantee of discovering the former, only with his ex-partner after literally turning his back on her. She follows him by turning her back on him and telling him about the past, yet does not change his plans. He also says a little to Hunter when drunk and being selfish.A classic piece of cinema.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films."
69,"If action movies are your thing, you'd probably best steer clear of this one.This is a wonderful poignant story of a failed relationship and human flaws re-lived in hindsight. It is a bit of an art-house movie that won't appeal to the masses. But for those of you who like a movie to slowly unfold and tell a simple story in a tender way, you will love it. The movie cleverly allows the audience to absorb the story at their own pace.I re-visit this movie every few years and it still evokes tremendous emotion for me. The one scene where they are talking through one-way glass and their heads appear as one is one of the most beautiful cinematographic images ever seen. The way the two characters talk about their failed relationship in hindsight is just heart-wrenching. Have a box of tissues handy - you'll need them! There's a lot of raw emotion and a young child involved. The re-born relationship between father and son is delightful - maybe not very realistic, but that doesn't matter!! This is my idea of a great movie!!"
70,"Play Paris, Texas! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!"
71,"For me Paris, Texas is absolutely the best best film ever made. The dialogues, the atmosphere, the emotions, the impossible relationship between Jane and Travis, the photography, the score and most of all the story are brilliant. Unfortunately Wenders doesn't make such good movies anymore. His last good movie was 'Der Himmel uber Berlin' and maybe 'Until the end of the world'. But after the latter...only reasonable. I'm still hoping for better times!"
72,"This is a sleepy film, with a slow moving and sometimes confusing plot. However in the end , you'll find it an enjoyable film. The Ry Cooder soundtrack really sets the slow pace but adds intrigue to the film."
73,"I haven't seen this movie in many years and ""perhaps"" I should watch it again...BUT I remember trying to get through it the first time was sheer torture. I kept waiting for ANYTHING to happen. You know how you will stick with a movie ten minutes at a time after the first half you think, ""It's got to get better"". Not this one. It was the most boring piece of crap I have EVER seen. One of these days, maybe...when I'm in a vegetative state and nobody is around to change the channel, I'll watch it again. NOT!!!!!!!!!!!For some reason the hamsters here think that it requires some long drawn out critique of a movie for us to express ourselves. Unlike ""professional"" movie critics who blow smoke and pat each other on the back praising their pseudo-intellect. We can actually say whether we like or dislike a movie in a few succinct sentences. So, hopefully my entry is long enough now. It's a shame isn't it?"
74,"When I was about 18 years old I saw Paris, Texas, I guess I saw the movie when I was looking for a good channel. Now it's ten years later and I rented it, and old videotape. I remembered just the atmosphere and now I have seen it again I knew why I loved this movie. It was because I love a good told story. Well, I can't tell what's good about it. If you see this and you don't like the movie after ten minutes, just turn it off and watch something else. If you like to see a good movie, see this one. You wont be disappointed."
75,"I rented this movie based on strong opinions from IMDb users, do not be fooled. This movie is boring as anything you will ever watch. It goes from a slow moving drama to just plain annoying. This film is way too over-hyped! It being the 1984 Cannes Film Festival Winner even though Amadeus and Killing Fields were released the same year, proves the French know little about movies (Except the 94' Race).In short, don't watch this. I rent movies in pairs and also saw ""The Ghost and The Darkness"" which was a far more entertaining movie, so I suggest that for now."
76,The movie is really good and it shown how a man and his son desperate to find their wife and mother.
77,Wrap yourself into a cozy chair and pour yourself a hot chocolate as you enjoy this masterpiece.  Take the phone off the hook as well. Natasha Kinski with a Texas accent.  Dean Stockwell as a regular guy hero (sort of).  Harry Dean Stanton plays a role that only he could have played. Watch this.
78,"Sure, it's slow paced, but it stays entertaining. This movie holds a somber tone almost the entire time, but that allows the brief smiles and laughs to shine through. It's well written, the story is pretty unique as far as movies go. Kind of an anti-romance? The actors all did a great job, especially Hunter Carson (the little kid). This movie is ARTSY, and that's where its high ratings really come from. The cinematography, the metaphors, the outside-of-the-box directorial choices. I would argue that only those who call themselves film-lovers will truly appreciate this movie."
79,"I didn't know much about the movie, just the abstract of it. At first I was expecting another story behind the mystery of Travis appearing in the middle of nowhere in the dessert, little I knew I would encounter with a story about life, I could relate with some of the characters feelings and that is a feeling you don't find in every movie you watch.Probably it isn't a movie for everyone, is slow paced but with a deep meaning of family."
80,"Yes, the photography is excellent, but come on, how many movies have lousy photography? This is a film with such long pauses and such ham-fisted staging that I keep thinking one of the actors will break and ask, ""line?"" Ry Cooder, as usual, seems to be composing for another movie entirely, as his twangs and plucks do nothing but annoy. And who can abide the Euromorality of the film (meaning ""none""), wherein the least qualified person to take care of the child in any capacity is the one the film makers deem the only one do to the job. In certain cultures, rotten eggs buried for months are considered a delicacy, and if you enjoy such sulphurous tastes, eat hearty, for Paris, Texas serves a generous portion. If any film stock deserved to be recycled, it is the film stock for this. Truly detestable."
81,"What a delight: no car chases, explosions, bloody deaths, or computer generated bilge so prevalent today. The bottleneck guitar added a nice flavor to the production, also. Travis wandered alone in the desert in a self made hell because of his own sinful nature. Marrying a much younger woman only fueled his inner demons leading to a mess for his entire family. What a fool. Both he and his wife searched for years for a replacement for something they considered permanently lost only to lead unfulfilled existences on the border of living. I liked the way the story went on and on with no explanations about what caused Travis to trek into the wilds and then sprung it on the viewer in one gut wrenching scene in a Houston cubicle. The dialogue was never boring, but instead concise and well delivered, however, I did have a bit of trouble understanding the German lady's accent. 4 stars."
82,"Excellent performance of the beautiful (¬°so beautiful!) Nastassja Kinski, Wim Wenders is the only one that can reach the edges of human nature with such simplicity and a story that we can live as long as we love life. The meeting of Hunter and Jane is one of the best sequences, and the best shot of cinema history is the confession of Hunter and Jane, the meeting is so moving. I enjoy a lot every time i watch this film. I recommend this film, to every one that is not loving his mother, and wants to love her again, the portrait of the search of Hunter's mom is the best narration of a film ever done, there's no doubt about it. Wim Wenders is the best filmmaker in his gender, and is the only one that can get you out a tear, with the single existence of a simple take."
83,"After separating from his family, a man (Harry Dean Stanton) goes missing in the hinterlands of America, and turns up years later to reunite with his son - and his wife, now working as a stripper.The plot meanders and sometimes strays from logic, but this film is all about appearances: director Wim Wenders and cinematographer Robby Muller linger on the arid, desolate stretches of Texas landscape, shooting it with an intense curiosity that may be the preserve of outsiders. Stanton, cast unusually in a lead role, is suitably enigmatic, a description that holds good for the whole picture. Still, it exerts a certain hypnotic fascination, reinforced by Ry Cooder's admirably sparse score. Paris, Texas was a co-production between companies in France and West Germany, but was filmed in the United States."
84,"The story is often hard to digest as a lot of the plot is seemingly unrealistic and the editing at times is unbearably awkward to follow. That being said, there are moments where the film is ripe with sentiment and emotion. The scenes in the booth are mesmerizing and as a viewer, I just wanted to yell at the screen to tell Travis what to do.The film is beautifully shot and Wenders captivates us with his choice in setting and the medium-long shots of vast Texan landscapes. There is a nostalgic charm to these settings that intrigued me more than anything else in the movie. The dialogue was just as ""lost"" and off-beat as the characters in the movie."
85,"I only wish I had the time to compose the maximum 1,000 words on this film. Let's face it, the camera was always in focus, so I can't fault the cinematography.  I tried hard and couldn't find a plot.  Last Year at Marienbad (which I find great) looks like a car chase compared to the ennui, the sheer boredom of this monumental waste of time and effort.  Ishtar looks like Citizen Kane in comparison.  It's just terrible.  If you liked, I can't see how or why."
86,"Wenders, M√ºller, Shepard, Cooder, Stanton, Stockwell. Could there be a better combination ‚Äì and concentration! ‚Äì of talent?Film is indeed poetry, and this is one of the most beautiful poems of parenthood I've seen. Not explicit, preachy, but otherworldly, subtle, comic, bittersweet. The alienation from one's own self, all of this internal, has its visual counterpoint first in the concept of walkabout in the open space, the desert, the quiet; then in the urbanity of modern life, the closed space, the airplane, the noise. Change, both internal and external (appearance such as the rugged beard, mutism), reflected in the road movie. His self-discovery is actually our discovery, not only of him but of the movie. Travis has two beginnings: as explained by him, he was most likely conceived in Paris, Texas. It was his first beginning, the film his second.Stanton is sublime. His ability to convey meaning and emotion through the slightest gestures and expressions is unprecedented. And yet, at the same time, his ability to conceal meaning and emotion is just as evocatively effective ‚Äì his face is a blank, his eyes devoid of anything one might connect to, finding meaning from. That lunch they're having together before hitting the road, father and son, somehow reifies the film's many narratives for me. There we have the walkabout/journey/highway and family/loss/past at an intersection. And it's a perfectly beautiful moment."
87,"No one knows better than we do how difficult it is to fix past mistakes.However, with determination anything it is possible, and what seemed hopeless, turns out a possibility.When i saw Travis, looking like a beggar in the desert, I could not imagine the reasons for their appearance. However, we all have a story, a past. The way in which the film develops the outcome is extremely intelligent, and it's like reality itself. This is why the film is moving and intense, despite of it's apparent lack of pace.8/10"
88,"""Thus, did Moses wander the desert for 40 years. And though he was allowed to see the promised land, he was not able to enter it. His only solace was leading others to it, that they might enter and lead a better life than him.""This was an idea from the Bible that had always stuck with me from Sunday School classes from my childhood. Paris, Texas is a modernised version of that passage, and it struck such a chord in me emotionally that I had to re-watch it the day after. I now consider it one of the, if not the, greatest film of all time.Travis (a mercurial Harry Dean Stanton) wanders out of the desert not knowing who he is. His brother (the always reliable Dean Stockwell) finds him, and helps to pull his memory back of the life he led before he walked out on his family and disappeared four years earlier. Travis decides to reunite his family, leading him and his young son, Hunter, on a journey in search of his wife, Jane.Even though Robby M√ºller's cinematography is perfection throughout. (Seriously, the colours pop in such a way that the film regularly looks like a work of art) The true beauty of the film is Wim Wenders' and Sam Shepard's ability to create characters that feel so real. I never thought I'd be able to emphasise with every single character of a film, but it's testament to both Wenders and Shepard's genius as filmmakers that it's possible in this film. The phrase ""cinematic poetry"" always struck me as an empty compliment, but it makes total sense to use it to describe this film. The one way mirrors of Jane's occupation speak so much volumes and furthers the divide between the man and his wife. It is not until Travis explains his behaviour that the barrier between them is broken. They are fully able to understand each other, and realise that the possibility of reuniting is truly unavailable. The physical barrier still exists, but the emotions they feel are able to conquer any border. Like all art for me, I can appreciate it even more if I feel an emotional connection to it. No other film has struck me emotionally in such a strong way in years. Travis leading Hunter to Jane in the hope of starting afresh as a family, and then leaving because he knew he couldn't be with them is just such a heartbreaking and beautiful idea to me. He wanted the best for the ones he loved more than his own life, and the best was not to be with him. So the man has to go on, leaving all that he holds dear and start again on his own accord with only the knowledge that they're happy together to keep him comfort. Truly stunning. That freaking gorgeous pink jumper that Kinski wears may be my favourite movie costume of all time."
89,"I've seen this film many times and I am continually dazzled by how fresh and pure the visuals are - thanks to the work of cinematographer Robby M√ºller, who provided German director Wim Wenders with one of his most beautiful films. The sense of scale and beauty invoked by M√ºller's lens deserves more praise than Wenders himself, because this is primarily a mood-film, one that subordinates its gentle human story to the luscious minimalist beauty of the desert. The slight story plays second fiddle to the brilliant camera-work and haunting music by Ry Cooder throughout until the last part. Here the film's visual beauty is undermined by an overlong and overbearing encounter between two main characters in a dark and dank setting. Sadly, this impacts the effectiveness of the film greatly, leaving the viewer alienated by the claustrophobic nature of this latter part in contrast with the breathtaking sense of space conveyed earlier. However, the acting is excellent, especially Harry Dean Stanton as Travis. A flawed masterpiece."
90,"It gets off to an intriguing start, as a man walks in from the desert after missing in action for four years. The first half of the film, which centers on Stanton's relationship with his brother (Stockwell) and his family, is fairly well done. As Stanton heads south to search for his abandoned wife (Kinski), so does the film, concluding with Shepard's pompous monologues. It's hard to understand what attracts a babe like Kinski to Stanton, whose character is bland, selfish, and some thirty years older than her. The pace is very leisurely, with Wenders showing no interest in the art of editing. Coder's score consists of about three notes repeated ad nauseam."
91,"I thought this was just an astounding character study, and it comes equipped with a group of excellent actors and a director who does not bow to commercial demands in terms of ""dramatic structure"".The film's story concerns a drifter named Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) who is re-united with his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who has been raising the drifter's son with his wife (Aurore Clement). There are some secrets in Travis' past, specifically what he has been doing for the past 4 years and how he and his wife (Natassja Kinski) ended up being separated. After heading on a journey to try to re-unite with her, bringing his 8 year old son (Hunter Carson) in tow, Travis must face the depths of evil within his own soul and try to discover if it's even possible to rebuild a life that was once destroyed.I think this is a marvelous film in terms of the execution.... it really keeps you interested even far beyond the point where the ""secrets"" are being revealed. In many ways the film plays on themes of voyeurism -- why are we interested in this story? Why do men go to Jane (Kinski) to talk about their issues? I think this film might mean something different to each person who sees it. The film is really sad in the sense in which it shows the consequences of some of our actions, how we destroy our own happiness. Jane tells Travis that she had to send Hunter away because she did not want to fill the void in her life with her son. Yet we know already that Travis cannot fill that void either. I think the film is not really ""saying"" anything -- it's more asking us to question the way we treat others and to realize that our relationships are the things that define us in many ways. I see this in Jane/Travis' relationship and also in the emerging father/son relationship between Travis and Hunter. For a few days Hunter is actually calling both Walt and Travis ""dad"" -- this awkward situation is something that work-a-day good guy Walt thinks is perfectly fine, but Travis I think realizes that the ""void"" cannot be filled with two dads.Wonderful film and I look forward to repeat viewings."
92,You can say many great things about the film but Ry Cooders soundtrack truly makes it one for the books. Years after seeing the movie I bought a CD of Cooders' movie songs and just from those songs I could picture and feel the whole movie as if I was watching it. This is a perfect example of what a soundtrack can add to a movie. One might feel that a movie producer heard some of Cooders' songs and wrote a movie about the way the music made him feel. Casting is another bonus. All the actors seem well suited for their roles and when you combine that with an atypical Hollywood ending....well one is sadly but pleasantly surprised.
93,"Everything about this movie is magnificent. The acting, the cinematography, the direction, the soundtrack (most of all), the writing, and everything else is just beautiful. The most beautiful story I've ever seen on the screen. There's nothing better than this movie for me.10/10!!!!!!"
94,"Wim Wenders's Paris,Texas is a film that is narrated through road trips. An utterly lost man (in every sense of the word) is tracked down by his brother and reunited with his son. On discovering a part of his old self, the man takes on a journey to bring his son back with his estranged mother. What the viewer doesn't know till the very end of the movie is as to why this family had been separated in the first place. The film's pace is quite in contrast to that of the fast and frequent road trips on screen. Although the slowness and did get to my head at times, I found the film quite riveting on the whole. The barren roads of Texas contrasted against the busy highways of Houston is an interesting feature of this film. At heart, ""Paris, Texas"" is an intense film about human separation and more importantly, reunion."
95,Slow and mopey and whispery and sulky and sullen and so boring I might never recover. I can't believe people find this entertaining. I'm legitimately mad that I wasted NYE sitting through this dull movie.
96,"A movie by Wim Wenders on IMDb's Top 250 list, starring Harry Dean Stanton is bound to be amazing, and of course, it is!It's a very well-written and well-acted movie, with lots of emotional punches and great character work, accompined by the actors incredible job.It's a film that can be viewed over and over, and, very likely, one of Wenders more accesible work, whereas he usually makes very deep and artistic films that might not suit everyone.Overall, a masterpiece!"
97,"Such a beautiful movie & the script was outstanding. Paris,Texas is now one of the greatest movies I've ever seen & I've seen a lot of films.
The music was incredible, the directing was unique. Buy your copy of criterion and enjoy the masterpiece, 11/10 I high recommend you watch this."
98,"Yesterday I re-watched this incredible well crafted piece of art. I saw it for the first time over three decades ago. At the time, I remember to think it was just an ""ok"" movie with great cinematography. Now re-watching it, I realized this film above all is a wonderful poem."
99,"I love this film. I learned a lot listening to director Wim Wender on the DVD commentary. Ry Cooder's score of ""Dark Was The Night"" (1928) by Blind Willie Johnson is perfect. With everything filmed on location, the final scenes in the peep show and hotel are perfect. A must see."
100,"The film builds quite well, and half way in........i felt it was peaking as the son and father are heading off together. I was excited for explanations and good payoff's upon the reunion. But it just wasn't.....it was weak and kinda tedious. There was just nothing interesting about the final reveal/discussions.The final couple minutes are nice but i won't be watching again."
101,"I have been in love with Wenders' Wings of Desire since I first saw it several years ago, so I taped this movie off of HBO2 or some such channel. I could NOT find this at a video store, and they don't sell it in any format anymore. The only thing left to be sold is the soundtrack, which doesn't make any sense to me (although it is a good soundtrack). More than one person thought that this film was an utter masterpiece, so why keep it off video? It won huge honors at Cannes, but it is completely unavailable. I loved this movie. It made me cry and it made me feel alive. The scene where Travis confesses his sins to Jane through the glass is so perfect and so affecting. Please, somebody, release this masterpiece to DVD. I want to see it again and share it with others."
102,"Brilliant cinematography, brilliant soundtrack and a moving and ethereal plot. Travis' and Jane's audio confrontation at the sex parlour is one of the most memorable interchanges in cinema. Rates as one of my favourite films."
103,"The art as others have said, is great - the Ry Cooder soundtrack, linear, no-frills screenplay, and heartfelt acting. But the story itself leaves a lot to be desired.The main character (Travis) comes out of almost literally nowhere and we find out he's abandoned his wife and child who was subsequently also abandoned by his mom, Travis' wife. Meanwhile, Travis' Brother and Sister-In-Law have taken in the child and love and care for him like he was their own. The boy in now part of their family. Lucky boy.Travis' brother takes in Travis who needs time to recover from four years of apparent drunken disappearance somewhere in the desert. Meanwhile Travis gets a chance to at least get to know and possibly reconcile with his boy. Lucky Travis.In getting to know his boy, Travis starts meeting his boy at school and at some point, he and his boy playfully match each other's strides and steps on the way home. This part is pretty cool and I agree with one reviewer who said that walk home should have ended the movie, fading as they disappear on their way to the boy's homeBut no. Instead, Travis who is basically a stranger to his boy takes him without the boy's family knowledge or permission to go find Travis' wife and the boy's mother. Basically kidnapping. The boy's mother knows where he's been living but has made no attempt to connect with him.So, is Travis some kind of emotional hero by basically kidnapping the boy he had abandoned from the boy's loving and dedicated family to find his wife and the boy's mother who also abandoned the boy? Leaving the boy's family desperate and to know where the boy is and deeply hurt once they find out?The mother it turns out works in a peep show. The possible reconciliation between Travis and his wife had possibilities, but there was little emotional energy there. Instead, Travis leaves his boy in the hands of the boy's stranger-mother and leaves again for who knows where.Unrealistic and emotionally empty story. Any normal boy would have longed to be back with the family that was devoted to him and actually loved him. As one reviewer said, this is a flawed story of a guy, Travis, sacrificing his boy on the altar of his attempt at his own restoration and redemption.The glitter of art cannot overcome your gut and conscience when the story doesn't make sense and runs over characters you care about without explanation or solution. The movie left me flat."
104,"This visually striking movie has something about it that makes me fall asleep within the first fifteen or twenty minutes. I'm not sure why, because whenever I resume it I always enjoy the cinematography. The characters are boring, sure. But that's never been a problem with big budget movies that have little character development. These people are very developed, they're just not interesting at all.Wim Wenders' movie is either very overrated or extremely underrated as a work of art, a classic and Criterion worthy. I am fascinated by the idea of a man wandering into the world from the middle of nowhere, but where the story takes us is boring. The early eighties look of the movie along with the cars and clothing makes me resent it even more."
105,"I was marveled with this astounding movie, the loneliness of it, the desperate and passionate feeling all around. This movie ranks on my top 5 favorite movies of all time. It has to do, also, the fact that I identified myself through the characters especially 'Travis'. I've experienced that same kind of love and desperation, which, somehow, made me feel that it's o.k. to live this life through passion.The Cinematography is clever, and the direction is carefully driven. the screenplay, along with the soundtrack and cinematography might be the tip-top of the film.If you happen to see it on a video store, rent it, buy it, don't hesitate you won't regret, this is a must see."
106,"This film deals so well with its central story of a man returning to his life,from a self-imposed isolation. The use of locations, and photography ,particularly in the earlier sequences of the film, just capture the sense of the wilderness ,both within and without-side, this person. When Travis is staring away down the railroad tracks into a dry ,dusty infinity, the wind is blowing, it just burns the image into your mind. I find something so pure and beautiful in these bleak, desolate vistas. In direct comparison ,the film also has great humanity and warmth. Travis earning back his sons trust, is particularly touching.This film is a keeper, it just works so well, and never disrespects its audience, to be fair it is very taste specific, so it wont be for everybody, but if it works for you, it will truly touch you."
107,"Few films have moved me so deeply as ""Paris, Texas"". It's a  story of trying to rebuild  relationships ,the battle zone between men and women, and the undying bond between fathers and sons. All the performances are excellent: Harry Dean Stanton as a drifter brought back to reality to make amends with his family, Nastasha Kinski playing a southern belle (!), and young Hunter Carson's as a young yet brave lad willing to take an adventure by taking a road trip and getting to know the dad he never knew.  One of Wim Wenders ""road movies"" and one of my personal favorites.  Ry Cooder's soundtrack adds to the films mesmerizing mood.  ""Paris, Texas""  deservedly won best picture at the Cannes Film Festival '84, it's also one of the few films that made me cry.  Most highly recommended. 10 out of 10."
108,"...because I pride myself on having never teared up watching any movie or TV show, but the last 20-30 minutes of Paris, Texas left me an emotional wreck."
109,"Romantic view about America by Wim Wenders. In my opinion this is one of the most beautiful, most visually poetic visions about the US. It has one of the best soundtracks ever... Ry Cooder goes the extra-mile on this one. a movie full of metaphors, and odes to America. There's not much I can say about it, aside from: see it with your own eyes. It feels like a Jack Kerouac romance and it looks like a Wim Wenders movie.Land of the Plenty, feels like an attempt to recreate this with a political feeling. My opinion is that it's not near as good as this, this is the real thing. A great American movie, done by a great European Director."
110,"I'm going against the tide here.The story, for me, is absolutely plain. Not only that, the movie, itself, is unnecessarily long and boring. There are literally dozens of shots where you find yourself fast forwarding because nothing relevant is happening: long walks in the desert, car rides, home videos, more walks, even the final scene, that you expect is gonna somehow make up for the over-two-hours-long tedium - it does not! - is boring.The movie ends, perhaps predictably, in a rather anti-climatic - I might add stupid - fashion, which, for me, is also a turn-off; why would someone who, perhaps not knowingly, is atoning his past shortcomings, and the hurt that he'd caused to wife and kid, kidnap is own son, taking him away from where he's loved and cared for, and return him to his mother, who had abandoned him as an infant and, let's face it, probably still hasn't really got it all figured out, and then walks out on both of them?But I guess some directors (or writers) love it when a movie does not have a happy ending; that way they can call themselves ""realistic"" directors, or something philosophical and hipster like that.To summ up, you find yourself thinking how bad do the other movies in that decade have to be so that ""Paris, Texas"" can stand out."
111,"I'm not a film snob-- mostly a film buff (there's a difference.) I'm also a film student, and many other inspiring directors may thing that I should be flogged in the testicles with a bull pizzle for never seeing a Wim Winders' film. Now that I have, maybe they're right. The film was the embodiment of isolation. Character action (Travis getting into the back seat of the car, Travis not speaking, Travis getting rejected from his son when he wants to walk him home, etc,) as well as lighting. Notice when Travis's brother (an impeccable performance by Dean Stockwell) takes him to the 'Rancho Motel' near the beginning of the film. A dark green tint is used, showing how distant this all seems in the eyes of the protangonist. Once they're actually in the room, the walls are pale, white, bland-- like a mental hospital. But when Travis looks into the mirror we see a cool blue, and when his brother appears we see the same. The super-8 footage is the biggest heartbreaker. The child, distancing himself from his father, wakes up... No more than that, I hate spoilers. As I've mentioned, Stockwell was amazing, almost very cool. We know he loves his son, but he really cares about his brother no matter what. Because I'd never really known where he came from outside of ""Blue Velvet,"" it was very interesting to see. Harry Dean Stanton I've always known, and has always been on my top 10 underrated actors of all time list (I'm not giving the whole list, sorry, but I will say the writer of this film, Sam Shepard, is also on it.) He never needed to speak, his facial expressions and body movements often did the speaking for him. His name was Travis (like ""Taxi Driver,"" but don't let that throw you. It's a different isolation here folks."") Travis is apt because he was a travesty, he was messed up. He sinned and he wasn't even seeking forgiveness, rather, solace. (When his bother is upset with him about flying, he says ""It's alright if you leave me."") Apart from that, this film needs a DVD release. No extras, fine, but the print that I saw was the VHS crapped out version... With cinematography like this, it deserves more."
112,"If you haven¬¥t seen this movie yet, I truly envy you, because you are in for a treat. Relax and let yourself be drawn in by the slow pace and you will be absolutely lost for 2 1/2 hours. This (sort of) road movie about (lost) human relations is so powerful, that you will be affected way beyond the normal time that the average ""easily digested and forgotten movie"" does. It touches your soul, it truly does. Give it the time and the calm it deserves and it will enrich your life!"
113,"I first saw Paris, Texas when it was released in 1984. I was moved tremendously by Wim Wender's haunting masterpiece. His use of height imagery is amazing. The scene with Travis following the shadow of the plane instead of the plane itself is one of the best I've seen. A few years ago, I picked up my own copy, and have since watched it several times. It continues to move me. I simply love this film. It's beautifully acted, with a superb soundtrack. A must see."
114,"This is a movie about ruining a kid's life. It is not endearing nor a love story. People finding the beauty in this story aren't right. That said, visually it gets to look pretty good at times but it's uneven in its cinematography and acting. I can confidently say it's overrated."
115,"From seeing the poster and the summary of this film I thought it wouldn't be great and maybe slightly boring. However, I was very much shocked by the movie. It had a great story and, I felt, maybe the audience go through many emotions. I had not heard of this movie before I watched it, but now I think that this film deserves to get out there and become a classic. Basically to some up everything, I really do think that you should watch this film. If you like dramas then you'll love this. I don't want to give the ending away, but there are some certain scenes that will move you in a way that you will love. So again, watch this film for definite."
116,"One of the greatest film titles ever, one of the greatest opening sequences ever, Paris, Texas is just that-a clash of opposites, of cultures and concepts. German director Wim Wenders, facing an American cinematic idiom: the road movie. An opening sequence where a man in a suit appears in the Texan desert(later the desert is contrasted with the city, LA). The man is lost. He is searching for his wife and child. He could be a cowboy at odds with the modernity. Great acting, great soundtrack. He finds his son and slowly he is saved. He finds his wife in a Houston strip joint and, separated by a one-way mirror(what a metaphor!), they save each other. And then off again into the desert."
117,"This is a movie that hosts a canyon of mordant themes. A beauty of it resides in the mastery of how simply they are cultivated and interconnected.Travis, now an all-time favourite movie character of mine, is a man that came to be able to take root in that wild, alone world at a late period of his life. Through, of course, love. Love of no hesitation, no limitation. Love, as a wholehearted presumption of infinity about something definitely finite. It grows so pervasive and intense to fill entirely up the old (and thirsty) and large soils of his existence. So much that its absence, the moment of the disroot, gradual and sudden at the same time, is enough to make a bone dry desert out of that terrain greened with love. Then, the inevitable drive (inveitable from being human) to take root whatever may come possesses his fresh and volumnious and decaying emptiness, and brings him to the actual desert that resembles his lost soul with the deep-down, unconscious beacon of hope to uncover (presumably) the authentic roots of himself: Paris, Texas. In what? In the lost history of his lost family. It seems thus much like a deep drilling to the depth of his existential roots as an odyssey rather than a journey. The curious thing is that Travis' having pinpointed that actual desert (by buying it) much before he lived the existential desert. It suggests more than it does outloud, I believe. If you think about it a bit more deeply, it is not a story about a strange, traumatised man but, through his moments, an invitation to take courage to reflect on the depth and breadth of our existential roots in that world.Another beauty of the movie, that strikes me, is its cinematographic economy (or fit-ness as one may like) and the feeling of ""as it should be"" that it leaves behind. The vibe I try to stress is, I guess, captured especially in or after the modest darkening passages between the scenes. It's not long, it's not fast. Not at all. It is at ""that"" measure so as to make you go caught the stream of the story.I don't even bother myself to mention the mastery of actings.This is a movie made me (a person who tries to see movies whenever possible) thought after: finally ""a movie"", after a considerable time! It contains everything what I come to seek in movies after years and more. That more was there to broaden my horizon in a way bestowed on the seventh art.I would suggest you to watch this masterpiece and rewatch it under a light that at least kept me if not already you hitherto."
118,"This movie was miserable.  The dialogue was too much, the film was too long, nothing much happened.  Harry Dean Stanton and Kinski are not believable as a couple, being that she would have been in her early 20s at the time of filming and Stanton would have been 58 years old.Remember critics always give awards to bad films.  The English Patient got 8 of them.This post is required for a class about film.  Hope you see it, Herr Genco."
119,"Long, artsy and beautifully photographed, 'Paris, Texas'(1984)stars the wonderful character actor Harry Dean Stanton as a drifter who re-appears after a four year unexplained absence and seeks to reunite with his young son and wife. Stantons performance was worthy of an Oscar nomination and Ry Cooders soundtrack perfectly captures the mood of the film. If action is what you seek, this critically acclaimed movie is not for you, however one of the better character study films around. Great screenplay by Sam Shepard"
120,"By the end of this movie (no spoiler here), the plot kicker, the pain of love won and lost wrenches the soul. The title plays on this duality; Paris (France) and a plot of dirt in Paris, Texas. Hunter (the son of this ill conceived union) innocently asks if they were to live on the plot of dirt he sees in the picture Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) carries around. Texas vs France, get it? The players are excellent, with slow paced responses and steady acceptance unusual in intensity but consistent with the style of the movie. The realism style of cinematography balances well with the storyline. A nearly great movie, marred by a bit too much sentimentality and some inauthentic plot elements."
121,"Maybe, the best movie I`ve ever seen. Surely, it`s in my TOP-TEN. Desperately recommended."
122,This movie was seen the first time around 15 years ago and touched me with a way that left me with a deep reverence for the extremes of emotions it portrayed..... I can honestly say that this film made a significant impact to me and my life in a way that was respectful of the delicate balance we are all in as we continue our journeys of existence while alive. I would be interested to know if this had similar affects to others especially as I am an English person living in the United States. The movie has and will always give me a torturous and heart wrenching view of the extremities of relationships and how love can be so pleasurable yet so painful as well.
123,"'Paris, Texas' happens all in California and Texas, and uses some of the iconic landscapes in the American cinema like Los Angeles viewed from the heights, the Mojavi desert or the endless Texas plains. These are filmed in such a vibrant manner and combined with the original music by Ry Cooder that they became icons by themselves, in one of the most American films I have seen, made by a German director who we feel that he really loves America.Child-to-adults relationship movies are not really my preferred genre. I often find them exploiting the sentiments of the viewers and the ingenuous style of acting of children at the expense of real feelings. Here however the acting of Hunter Carson is really so direct and so true that I am almost happy to see that he did not develop a film actor career and will remain in memory for everybody with this role. Maybe he did have some conversations with Dean Stockwell, who also was a child actor who became a professional, one may just guess.Acting is really fabulous in the movie, beyond Carson and Stockwell we have Harry Dean Stanton with one of the best performances in his career. This story of lost memory and getting back and putting together a broken life is simple and moving, we are not told details that are not important for the relations between the characters, and even if the ending may be disputed from a social or moralistic point of view (is really the runaway girl working in a men's club the best mother for the kid?) it makes sense from an emotional point of view.This is one of the best films of director Wenders together with 'Himmel uber Berlin' and 'Buena Vista Social Club'. Three memorable movies, and so different one from the other. He is one of the best."
124,"Paris, Texas is tells the adventure of a wanderer named 'Travis' (Harry Dean Stanton) is found in the middle of nowhere by his brother who helps pull his memory back together; a memory that haunted him and started four years ago. Once his memory comes back, Travis starts to fix up his haunted past. Many reviewers say this film is 'near-perfect', but I strongly disagree... it is 'perfect'! The film is so beautiful, so sad and so haunting, especially the soundtrack by Ry Cooder. Some people may say that it dragged-on but I also have to disagree on that one because I thought the pacing was perfect, since it makes the viewer become more familiar with the story and the characters. Hary Dean Stanton's performance as the haunted Travis is Finally, the ending of the film is absolutely... well... left me speechless.Paris, Texas is a film that we rarely get these days, it's a film like no other."
125,It's the best movie I've ever watched. It's kind of a movie that can change your life. Cheers Travis.
126,"beautiful shots, gorgeous landscape, nice idea for a plot but really far to slow to drag viewers in. The ideas behind the film are very interesting and at first you watch with all intention of following things until the end; the strange silent man (Travis) is intriguing enough in the beginning to catch all your attention. However as the story progresses, or rather fails to, Travis' silence becomes more infuriating than a helpful and necessary plot device. i find you just cant sympathize with Travis at all, and he just ended up as being irritating. Regardless of that, the real star of this film was the little boy who played Travis' son (name? unsure). fantastic acting from him, but all said and done, you'd be better off watching this film on mute."
127,"I'm not sure what's about the movies of Wim Wenders. When I saw the first time ""Der Himmel √ºber Berlin"" aka ""Wings of desire"", I thought to my self: ""Nice movie, but what else?"". I tried to capture the magic and the atmosphere of the movie but I could find it. A few days later I thought about it again and then I felt this unexplainable attraction of this movie. The same way it was with ""Paris, Texas"".Only a few days later I understood the message, it's a kind of philosophical point which is the fascination for this movie. Any way, it's a good movie and the music is very characteristic for the scenes of the movie, for example when Travis walks in the desert."
128,"Wim Wenders was one of the filmmakers who formed new German cinema in 1970's and his film Im lauf der zeit (In the Course of Time) ,alongside with Volker Schl√∂ndorff The Tin Drum, is often seen as one of the finest representatives of the movement. In 1984 after becoming quite famous in Europe Wim Wenders went to America to produce his first film outside of Germany. Paris, Texas is a masterful road-movie, which was Wenders' favorite genre; he even made a road-movie trilogy in 1970's (Alice in the Cities, False Movement and In the Course of Time). This slow-paced, mature, one of the director's most acclaimed films and his most accessible film, requires heart, certain maturity and patience from its viewer.A quiet man, lost for four years walks in the desert, due to dehydration a man picks him up and takes him to a hospital. Soon the quiet man is taken in by his brother. Later on the man tries to put his life back together and remember what happened between him, his wife and, his 8-year-old son.Paris, Texas could easily be a film which makes one to die for a ticket to the States. The landscapes, the gorgeous images reinforced by sentimental and honest music make us see into the true soul of America. 1980's and Americanism can be seen everywhere in the film, it is cleverly and precisely created: cokes, sodas, American cars, country music, clothes and landscapes. The construction of state in Paris, Texas is incredibly well handled and the contrasts Wenders has created are astonishing.This profound film about a quiet man, lost woman and the unification of a disintegrated family really drills down to pure emotion. Difficulty of communication and losing one's identity have both been very important themes for Wim Wenders already in Im lauf der zeit (1976). In Im lauf der zeit the two men don't know how to talk to each other, how to talk about your worries, memories and past. But in Paris, Texas the theme of difficulty of communication was taken to a new level: what can you say to the people you once left behind? How can you ever make up the mistakes once made? It's about the impossibility of understanding others, how can you relate to a person with completely different emotions. The change of identity is a scary thing and this theme culminates in the scene where Travis (the quiet man) tries different kind of outfits, trying to find the right suit for his new identity.Alongside with the themes of identity and communication, Paris, Texas is an emotional film about loneliness. The difficulty of understanding and empathy. Perhaps Travis can't make up the mistakes he once made and he is alone. He finds his long lost son and his wife, but understands that he's unable to live with them and is once again left alone, lonelier than ever before. Paris, Texas is a timeless film about loneliness and the later film by Wenders Wings of Desire (1987) can easily be seen as an antithesis for it; it has got certain eras, ages and a history. This profound theme of loneliness culminates in the unforgettable images of men sitting, standing and walking alone in Paris, Texas.In the end Paris, Texas grows out to be a mature film about family, the disintegration and the unification of it. It's a smooth and quality film in style, thematics and content. The delimitations and states are important and full of significance. After seeing the film twice I consider it as a very touching, melancholy road-movie about soul-searching, identity and family. It's a very good film, even if it's not Wenders' finest. I strongly recommend people to get to know his earlier and later German production. Wings of Desire (1987) and In the Course of Time (1976) are for instance two unforgettable masterpieces."
129,"I saw this movie in London back in 1984,I was 19 or 20 at the time,now I`m 36 and no movie affects me more personally.I was on my own that first time and I have never shared the experience with anyone,no friends none of my girlfriends not even my wife,whom I feel would not really understand it. I dont think before I saw it I had realised what a fine actor Stanton is,although I had seen one or two fine performances from Kinski and I became a Ry Cooder fan after Southern Comfort.As for Wim Wenders I have always looked out for his movies since (I especially enjoyed Himmel Uber Berlin/Wings of Desire).I should point out that I always find the climactic scene in the booth almost unbearable . For some reason I have never owned Paris,Texas on video,having occasionally updated my Television copies of it,I sincerely hope we will soon see a DVD that does it justice.Please."
130,"This was painful to watch. Maybe like fine wine this movie will get better with time. But I,as a 24 year old at the time,had little use for this slow,(how slow does radium decay?) painful, melodrama."
131,"I think that Paris, Texas is an absolute gem. This film plays on many levels, and relies on one's imagination to fill in pictures while listening to the dialogue. Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski are just mesmerizing together in the second half of the film. I've about worn out the VHS tape that I taped off of the Movie Channel. Hat's off to Sam Shepard! What a writer!"
132,"I recently watched this movie again for the first time in about 15 years, this time on 1080 HD.I have to say that I had forgotten the second half of the film almost entirely; it's that kind of film.But - the cinematography alone is worth watching/re-watching this film for - sumptuous colourful and beautiful. Fantastic to look at virtually every frame. The Music by Ry Cooder is one of the best movie soundtracks in the history of cinema; it's simply brilliant.The plot (or story, if you like) of this film is essentially very simple. You get to the end and you say to yourself ""yes, of course"". It's not about loss, separation, grieving, that would be too obvious. Remember - this film comes from a time before movies got clever with their audiences. In the end this film is what it seems; about a father who has to come to terms with, and do something about, the fact that he wasn't fitted for a relationship with the mother of his son. There aren't many other themes (although one would be the sub-story of Stantons brother and sister in law who have adopted the boy and see him pretty much as their son. The sister in law wonders what will become of their relationship if the boy goes away). The only possible outcome is the one arrived at in the final memorable and superb monologue.The thing for me about Paris, Texas is that; like Harry Dean Stantons' character - time changes a person. Since I first saw this movie in the cinema in 1985 my age has doubled and I now have a child of the same age as the boy in the film (also wonderfully acted). I see this film very differently now to the way I viewed it back then. Any father would see resonances from Stanton to their own life. I love this film for the way it makes me think about the way I relate to those who are close to me; Can I handle it? What would happen if I couldn't? Nevertheless - Paris, Texas is not for me one of the greatest films ever made, and it is not in my collection of DVD/BluRay. Why? Yes - its set in a decaying landscape both emotionally and physically. Yes - Stanton is wonderful as the lost guy coming out of the wilderness, BUT. Near the beginning of the film the doctor extorts money from Stantons brother - who is a long way from home and finds that he has to pay the doctor in order to complete his mission. The whole film is like this; there is feeling of moral and emotional blackmail running right through and all the adult characters have been afflicted, damaged if you like, by emotional blackmail to a lesser or greater degree. The only one who hasn't is the little boy. These tensions are revealed but not resolved. Even though its obvious that the issues cannot be resolved you get to the end and you feel irritated when indeed they are not. The question which you feel ought to be the central one - why Stanton walks out on his former life - turns out not to be - it's only the spark that sets the flame. The viewer is thus caught up in the emotional blackmail too; we want to see resolution - but.... However, I guess it is clever for that....I liked the film and I would highly recommend it. I haven't read any other reviews here on this movie (and I will be interested to do so as soon as I post this...). I would welcome too any comments made on my submission - as movies of this calibre are well worth observation and discussion."
133,"The star of this film mainly did supporting characters, such as Alien, and this is one of the rare occasions he has a leading part, and a great one. The film starts with the lonely drifter Travis Anderson (Harry Dean Stanton) walking through the desert, till he collapses (exhaustion) in a near bar. With his identification, the man there contacts his brother Walter R. Anderson (Dean Stockwell) he hasn't seen for four years, since he disappeared. His brother takes him home on the road (when he can't get on a plane), and when they get there, Travis meets his son who Walter and his wife Aurore Cl√©ment (Anne Anderson) have looked after since he and the mother disappeared, named Hunter Anderson (Hunter Carson). After getting used to his Dad, both Hunter and Travis decide to try and find the mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski) by finding the bank she visits every month, and luck strikes when Hunter spots her in the car park (recognised her face from photo). When Travis investigates the building she enters, he finds out she has become a peep-show stripper (stripping for someone she can't see because of two-way mirror, reflection on her side). The emotional part is slowly telling his story, as someone else, and she realises it is him. It is uncertain what happened after Jane and Hunter met each other in the hotel, and Travis wandered off, but this is an essential drama. Oh, the meaning of the title by the way, is that Travis bought a piece of land called Paris, in Texas, and his Dad joked making everyone think he was first talking about Paris, France. It won the BAFTA for Best Direction for Wim Wenders, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Score for Ry Cooder and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Very good!"
134,Wow what a movie. Great storyline and just great life tale. Acting is phenomenal especially the young boy Hunter did great job. If you don't know what to watch check this movie.
135,"That quote there from another review I saw here is absolutely spot on. This is a slow movie, quite long and for most people who's attention span won't last it will completely miss the mark for them. However, I cannot emphasise enough that if you allow yourself to get invested into this story the ending is powerful. I didn't cry, wasn't left happy, just really moved in a way I can't describe.A must view for any cinema junkies like me."
136,"Bad acting, unbelievable story, and goes on for 150mins, watched to the end just because I was curious to see what the others might have liked (the final few minutes perhaps; nonetheless those were boring and predictable too) and still don't quite get why it was so highly rated"
137,"I'm not going to be able to add much to the well-deserved accolades previously laid onto this timeless gem. Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski, Dean Stockwell, Aurore Clement, and all of the rest of the cast should look back on this film and take tremendous pride in contributing to this masterpiece. WHAT A FILM!!!!"
138,A man wanders in the desert after four years of absence. who left shortly after the man disappeared. 10/10
139,"Texas, Paris is a very interesting and unique film. The story is told from a quite different perspective than usual, the storytelling is unusual. It has one of the best cinematography I've ever seen which makes this film truly beautifully looking. It's arty and inovative. One of the better slow burners."
140,"Director Win Wenders knows perfectly how to showcase and transmit, through each scene's color scheme, the emotions characters experiment.Paris, Texas will be a good movie-night selection anytime, anywhere."
141,"Not my taste but I can still see its marvelous brilliance in tempo and directing. Paris, Texas is Wim Wenders greatest work, he still has the slow tempo and his special style which perhaps is hard to like, but in this one he fulfills his longing."
142,"mild yet grandly cinematic, this film may in some ways seem understated but it lets itself get caught up in it's characters and their emotions. amazingly photographed of course and exquisitely scored the real treat and the thing that keeps me coming back to this film is it's power to move without drawing attention to itself. it is a film about normal people and the ways in which they relate to, and fail to communicate with each other. because of this there such emotional distance between the characters that you can feel it- it is what stands out- all the primary performances are amazing but they work off each other as an ensemble. paris, texas is an extremely rewarding experience- it lets us revel self-indulgently in it's beauty."
143,"This is a beautiful piece of art. Direction is great and I just fell in love with the cinematography. I think only a few films like this can ever be made again, maybe only WW can. Other aspects of this movie are also first-class, the story, the music and the acting.Another thing that makes this film special is that there are many extraordinary sequences, unexpected things, e.g. Travis sits at the back instead, he gets out of the plane just before take-off, picking the right red car¬Ö I saw this movie for the first time last night. I just sat there in the dark, my wife went to sleep early, The colors, the lighting, the pictures were the most that moved me. The sad mirror scene. Simply excellent."
144,"A man wanders the desert for the first time in four years. His brother finds him and returns with him to reunite the man with his little son. Shortly thereafter, he and the boy went out to find the mother of the child who left shortly after the man disappeared."
145,"The film begins with an overhead shot, an eagle's gaze that dematerializes; as if it were the continuation of Centaurs of the desert. However, we already know who to look at; Travis (Harry Dean Santon) travels through the desert, with a disoriented look; without motivation. All he knows is that he wants to go to Texas, to a place called Paris.Paris, Texas tells how that gaze, empty at first, makes sense. Travis chose to forget about his own life and walk the world. When his brother finds him, he is forced to resume his relationship with his son; what will make him a new person willing to regain his old life. It is the tender story of how the purpose of living returns to the body from which it had fled.However, Travis was happy. His brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) still has a Super 8 recording of an old vintage vacation. The projected images are a deluge of emotions for Travis and the viewer. In that same scene, and four years later, his son calls him ""dad"" again.Paris, Texas is the story of how a gaze has a body again; but for me it goes much further. Wenders condenses emotion and makes it blossom little by little, coming up against the essence of cinema: absolute love. Travis is only looking for eyes that look at him, a back shot. And that cannot be expressed with narration alone. Wenders even goes beyond the borders of emotion: mother and son meet again while Travis watches them from the parking lot, just before getting in and driving towards Paris, Texas. But now he is another man, his look is different and he has tears in his eyes. It is a movie from another world, a film masterclass, and the best I've seen in many, many years."
146,I've not once heard that the excellent Ry Cooder's original soundtrack is much better than the film. And I'd like to say that they are equivalent. This is a masterpiece about incommunicability among human beings. The characters almost never have a face-to-face conversation. And it's a movie made before the Internet era...
147,"How this low-budget, pretentious, and seemingly interminable film deserves a high rating is beyond me. A script that must have looked (to those concerned)aesthetically and financially good on paper turns into a disaster on the screen. The acting is wooden. Each character comes across as memorizing lines, and even worse the lines promote a teasing of episodes failing in both dramatic and psychological conflict. The frames fall in a series of suggestive motives and ""profound"" insights worthy of a high school production, maybe. And the camera work? At times fixating in dissociative relationship with the script, but for the most part flat and amateurish. Odd. The film's theme of emotional healing is belied by its own clumsy and uninspired devices."
148,"It is truly rare in film when you are presented with a character whose life you are immediately intrigued by.  Paris, Texas gives you that kind of character.  From the first moments you see this man walking across the barren southwest in no particular direction you wonder.......where is he going and why?  The entire film thoughtfully explains just those questions. This movie is subtle and deep.  The performances are uniformly top notch with Harry Dean Stanton playing the role of his career.  This is not a film for those who are drawn to big budget Hollywood pictures.........it is for those who want to truly consider the arc of a troubled man's life.  This is a fantastic film!"
149,Insightful on how some can abandon those they love in a truly honest way rather than the unrealistically dramatic way most movies approach the 'why' of it all. Surprised Stanton wasn't recognized with awards for his incredible performance.
150,"As Forrest Gumps said life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get . In this film that chocolate is poisoned with passion and fury of woman. Sometimes whatever you do ,can not be sufficient for keep ur love. People changes like their love thats why can not find a immortal love. When u play for until last trump, exhasuted person is gonna u non suspicous. Always tolerate to other side of relation not be succesfull. Therefore, you should not adopt ur life to A person or temporal things. There is always another option in ur life.
This man exhausted hence his compromises . He had escaped to unparticular where. But he even did not know thing what you escaped. he caused collapse life of little child. how can we hope from this child to normal acts in his future ? Lifes are over like snowball by depens on each other"
151,"A long road trip, the pictures and music are really beautiful, the story is a bit depressed, in fact, it looks pretty sweet, the father-son relationship, the brotherhood, the lost love, but it is just too mysterious and weird, probably my own problem, As we grow older, we have no more nerves to bear such repression, closed spaces, unspeakable hidden feelings, and unpredictable future. . . The stubbornness of the actor sometimes makes people feel quite cute, but more often people hate him for being indifferent. This is a movie that is not suitable for anxious adults."
152,"As a woman I found this movie insulting, I watched it because it was an important movie for someone who's important for me, but I'm quite disgusted with it, it started alright, I found the sights and sounds appealing, but then, it's such a miscast, from the perfect cherub of Hunter, to the out of this world beauty of Jane (Kisnski), to the decrepit eyesore and bad actor of Travis (Stanton). It could have made a little more sense casting someone like Don Johnson instead of him, a young hunk. But you can't ask sense of this kind of garbage wrapped in artsy paper. This beautiful woman with a perfect son with the whole of the US to make a life for herself, turns into a pseudo hooker? That's all that she can strive for? And with that beauty and youth, she can only put in 5 dollars some months? While the sorry guy gets to go looking for adventures in Mexico? Give me a complete break! Piece of garbage."
153,"nothing will ever be, look, or react to you the same after this movie happens to you. do yourself a favor. i needed about 6 or 7 viewings to really get it, hopefully you'll need fewer, or better yet, hopefully you'll need more.here's my one sentence take: read the very first IMDb comment. that dude called it.i love how it gradually introduces and eases you into to so much. the color red. people trying to deal with the fact that they'll never understand the people they want to understand the most, by definition, and what to do with the realization that the most selfless solution to this very much unacceptable problem feels like the most selfish one. f***, i can't even talk about this movie. just see it like a million times."
154,"The story is pretty compelling and emotional in many ways. To stop understanding each other in a marriage... But the writers left all the explanation for the end, and that's not always bad. But in this one, doesn't make any good on the movie. It actually makes it kind of boring some times.
That's the only mistake of the movie, it does perfectly in everything else and even without explanation, doesn't feel lost in the points that the movie wants to go on."
155,"A vital piece of genuine American may be missing from Paris, Texas, but it still evokes an America that most Americans yearn to look on. An America as thorny and carnivorous as a hawk heel, as raw and smug as a mural in the center of the city, and as sweetly enigmatic as a vacant lot that can not exist."
156,"I don't usually watch movies like this, but I had to for faculty. It is a good and deep movie about loss, love, fatherhood and complicated relationships among people. While I dislike first part of the movie where our protagonist is silent and the whole thing resembles ""Rain Man"" more than anything else (not that it's a bad thing in art form of way, I personally just didn't like it), other half of the movie (or better said, more than half) is full of good scenes depicting a beautiful story about a son and a father looking for a mom whose location is unknown. From there on, the movie will hold your attention and you will enjoy it's every second. Therefore, I give the movie 8/10 and I recommend it to everybody who likes movies with themes like this."
157,"Lethargic and unassertive venture into a dreamy Texas with fluorescent lamps giving off a green tint and a display of an unreachable American dream trapped in an old faded picture of an old lot that Travis Henderson could not fulfill or had any tenacity to even hold onto for that matter. All this is accompanied by an extraordinary guitar score.Harry Dean Stanton gives a divine performance of an emotionally stunted man, whose experience of heartbreak and dejection might have whiplashed him so far from humanity that it takes up to 30 minutes to even hear him talk for the first time.The movie demands a lot of investment on viewers' part before this story of loss and redemption starts to unwind, but the reward for your time is one of the greatest monologues ever put to film and an ending that is so incredibly bittersweet it will make you ache and smile."
158,"Sometimes a movie that comes to you when you least expect it is your favorite movie, here is my movie...
Thanks for TRT2 showed this movie on TV.I had to say Hunter was my favorite characther ; his adaption, intelligence and intrepidity was excellent. Travis was cool but he was a complicated man tok because of that he thought jane was cheating on him and began the story. Jane was gorgeous , emotional and devoted to Hunter. She was without him but she was a mother worked a sex shop and send the money to Hunter.Finally, Hunter reunited with his mother but daddy wasn't there... Love turned into separation."
159,"Fantastic. Full of atmosphere, a real slow burner, great cast (there doesn't appear to be much credit given to the kid who was great too), great characterisation and beautifully shot. Some may describe the movie as depressing but I don't think that it is at all, just very sad, which is a different thing altogether. The music and photography also deserve a special mention, I've just got this movie on DVD and it is absolutely staggering. No wonder it doesn't get much of a mention any more - Hollywood with all its millions and so-called superstars would blush if any of the current trite efforts being piled out by the sausage factory were to be compared to this. Or perhaps they should and then they'd have to earn their millions for a change. If you like Arnie movies forget this one."
160,"Paris texas is one of films that has one of best written dialogues of all time,every scene in a film hold my attention to the maximum and i found myself in a moments were i havent blinked for few minutes,and that last 15-10 minutes were two characters were talking through a phone was so brilliantly written that it felt like some form of poet or shakespearan style of dialogue that give film extra bonus,also camera work on this film and entire cinematography is brilliant and some shots looked like they were some kind of painting,paris texas is one of best film i ever had a chance to witness and its slow moving and story that had big impact delivered it all to me in a way i didnt think it would"
161,"Perfection.This movie shows what it is been in love with the art of creating, writing, filming, directing.Great discover that little child was perfect for the role.In the end, while my heart was crying I just couldnt stop admiring what powerfull and perfect close scene.Go ahead, its perfect."
162,"It is a powerful and sad story by German director Wim Wenders, with the screenplay mostly written by Sam Shepherd. It features several remarkable performances by folks who are not usually leading actors.Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is a man who deserted his young wife and two-year-old son when he was no longer able to deal with his jealousy, alcoholism, and the recognition of his wife abuse. His much younger wife, Jane (Nastassja Kinski), still only about 20 years old, then does not believe she can provide their son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), what he needs and leaves him with Travis' younger brother and wife, Walt (Dean Stockwell) and Anne (Aurore Cl√©ment). They essentially raise Hunter as their son.Four years after he disappeared, Travis emerges from the desert speechless. A doctor calls a phone number he finds on Travis and contacts Walt, who comes from Los Angeles to south Texas to get his brother and to take him home.The film follows Travis' slow emergence from silence and his gradual reconnection with his son. Travis learns that Jane has also lost contact with Hunter, but sends small sums of money through a Houston bank for Hunter once a month. Without telling his brother, Travis and Hunter travel to Houston to locate Jane.Travis finds Jane working in a peep show and in a second visit to her booth has a long conversation with her through a one-way mirror, unpacking the story of their marriage and its collapse. Travis tells Jane that Hunter is waiting for her, but that he is too damaged to be part of the relationship. After Jane meets Hunter in a hotel, Travis drives into the night.This short summary doesn't do justice to the story. Harry Dean Stanton has performed many bit parts in movies, but never a leading role. He is amazing as Travis, a simple man unable to be reconciled with his demons. Dean Stockwell had given up movies and was selling real estate when he got the part of the brother, Walt, who works hard to rescue Travis, but ultimately can do no more. Young Hunter Carson was amazing as a seven-year-old boy who is often the leader in the Hunter-Travis relationship. Anne worries about her marriage with Walt if Hunter is no longer part of it. High quality all around.The title comes from the town where Travis had bought a vacant lot in happier times when he wanted to build a house for his family. The cinematography of rural Texas is excellent. The musical score undergirds the story.The sadness, which left me in tears, came in taking Hunter from Walt and Anne who had become his emotional parents, as well as the return at the end of the film of Travis to the desert from which he had briefly emerged at great cost. I loved the depth at which the characters were developed, though I was dissatisfied with the disappearance of Walt and Anne from the film in the second half. It felt like unfinished business."
163,"This film in a word is ""masterpiece"" i can't even define how i feel after watching this movie i just can't say i wasnt the same. This is a beautiful, emotional and rollercoaster experience to live, has very happy and funny moments and very sad moments- i just can say I cry like I never did before while watching this, it was so beautiful that i can't resist, I was no jokes like 40 minutes crying because i wouldn't stop. If you wanna appreciate a real film and what's cinema mean to be this movie is made for you, if you say you love cine this film is a need to you. Also has very beautiful shots and a excellet acting."
164,"What I love about Paris Texas is that it sits somewhere between a road movie and existentialist reflection.
You do see how Wenders uses this story to express a fascination with existentialism through the vehicle (sic) of road movie. The film for me has an obsession with the sadness of its own truth. With a screenplay by by the amazing Sam Shepard, (so much alienation and rage in his work), The film reflects themes that repeat all through Wenders' career. The American myth and the desert of contemporary life. 
Of course, as part of German New Wave, Wim Wenders' film does have a sense of European shifting narrative style and filmmaking techniques. But the collaboration of Wenders and Shepard's style imbue it with something truly original and essentially frightening -- a prediction of loss . Yes its about a man whose descent into madness and his return to the real world, he has to deal with loss. But its more than that. Is he mad or is the whole world mad as Antonin Artaud always implied?"
165,"If you enjoy watching paint dry or grass grow, then this is the movie for you. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. I was hoping upon hope that there was an underlying story; such as the brother left him to die in the desert to be with his girlfriend. But no. That would be too easy. This one was way too artsy-fartsy.A friend of mine recommended this film to me. He's still my friend, but I will no longer trust him when it comes to movie suggestions."
166,"Wim Wenders' most recent film was Buena Vista Social Club, which was more a documentary than a film, was very good...even though this one is totally different, I thought this one was even better. Harry Dean Stanton delivered a very good performance as a man who doesn't even know who he is, Dean Stockwell and Aurore Cl√©ment as a couple who want to keep Travis' son...but the one who impressed me the most in this film was Nastassja Kinski, who played a prostitute that still loves the man she left. She was amazing and beautiful. The mystery is kept for a long time, and that's only one of the things that keeps your attention on the film. The weird thing is that you wait a long time before seeing any evolution, and suddenly POW! it starts and by the time you realize it, the evolution is done...the last thirty minutes are awesome...you see the whole thing you were waiting for. Overall, I must say that it's a very good film...I give it 91%."
167,"I am sure that I was never very keen of this film originally almost 40 years ago, but find it wonderful now. It is lightly long and rather slow although it didn't seen a problem today. I am that aware Wim Wenders never had children but this seems certain of his loss. Written by Sam Shepard and it is a very well done especially as the story turns around but only slowly and the time lets us gradually get the full story. The cinematography is Robby Muller who frequently worked with Wenders and his photography characteristic colour and buildings with the billboards and the desert. The love but lost seem to help to the strange and worrying and the reason that Harry Dean Stanton's character seems crazy at first and then maybe not so bad."
168,"Leave it to a European to best express the alienating attraction of the Great American West: the silence, the distance, the wanderlust of neon lights and lonely desert highways. Like most road films this one works best on the road, during Harry Dean Stanton's odyssey across the Southwest in search of estranged wife Nastassja Kinski (who affects a convincing southern twang). There's more than a few slow spots between his comatose emergence out of the sagebrush and the final, troubled reunion, anchored only by Stanton's weather-beaten face and the haunting strains of Ry Cooder's slide guitar. The film ends with one of director Wim Wenders' typically intense, extended dialogues, during which Stanton sacrifices his past to save his future. Kinski isn't offered the same luxury, but a bittersweet resonance still lingers long after the final credits."
169,"I've never been to Paris, Texas but after seeing this I don't think I ever want to. This film has such a quiet little flame about it. I think it is something that is hard to recapture ever again. I would love to see a future remake of this project"
170,"Everything about this movie is so good.To some, the slow pace will fill either empty, simple or boring. If you are the type of person that expects, assumes or wants the plot to hit you right away. This movie isnt for you.Highly recommended to people that enjoy the complexity of the simple, and the smooth build of the plot."
171,"Paris, Texas really managed to build so much purity and authenticity without falling into naivety. Starts with an expressive and peculiar first act, ends with an intense and powerful third act. Great cinematography, excellent score, first-class acting. This is the 1984 Palme d'Or winner."
172,"I was reading a book titled ""1001 movies you must see before you die,"" and Paris, Texas was in there, thus compelling me to rent this movie and check it out for myself. I thought ""Hey, I am from Texas, and this was in that book, so it must be good."" I can say one thing about that book, and that is that they must've gotten the title wrong. They should rename it ""1001 movies you should see if you want to die."" Why do I say this? Because this movie is unbearrrabllleeeee!!! I've been able to learn many things in my lifetime, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why people were captivated by 150 of the worst minutes in film history. People will get this movie based on it's rave reviews and just out of curiosity. I guarantee you that 80% of you will be writing a review like mine shortly after you view this film."
173,"I'd heard about this film for quite some time and I had put if off, but still looking forward to it. I don't know, it's a good film, very elegantly and meticulously directed, but it didn't really have any lasting profound impact. The performances are very good, especially Harry Dean Stanton, who does a remarkable job leading the film in his quiet, conflicted character and not always doing things that the audience may see as presentable or likable, and also we have Natassja Kinski, who does nothing less than almost steal the show in the last act. I'd heard some all-time worthy mentions regarding her, and although I don't know if I'd ever go that far, I still found her compelling and able to create such a real, complex persona in such short screen time. Overall, a disappointing film, but a good one nonetheless."
174,"Saw this film first on the big screen 40 yrs ago, several times on video and once again last night. Wender's & Shepard's note on a stark, hard & yet a beautiful America is even more affecting today.. one of the most essential films in my list!Kinski takes over completely when she lights up the screen, but those are small moments. The film remains bleak and the performances by the entire cast leaves little to want, with a riveting slide guitar by Ry Cooder flowing through the entire film's soundtrack, sending up goosebumps all the way.Probably my favourite wenders film.. and surely a masterpiece of cinema!"
175,"Deathly slow pacing dances hand in hand with poetic visual accompaniments. Next, a screenplay so learned it flows like a tapestry of knowledge every other line. Paris, Texas is not only successful in reworking overused Americana in a new way, but it's also a multi-faceted fable that transcends its era and geographical origins.This is one of those few cases where a film unfolds ""like a play"" and it suffers none. Sometimes extended amounts of time are spent in one room, but it never wears its welcome. There's lots to see and take in even with what some might call its overly thoughtful pacing.
I'm not really smart enough to do it justice in writing, but let just say this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Wim Wenders, Sam Shepard and co. have crafted a masterpiece."
176,"I'm not quite smart enough to peel back the layers of this movie, but what I do know is this is a very special film, the type that doesn't come around too often. The third act specifically left me visibly distraught, fully immersed, the whole world faded except that little coffee shop room. Every shot so perfectly composed, every line so carefully written. The character arc is delicate and natural, nothing feels forced. I'm embarrassed it took so long for me to finally watch.FYI I wrote this around 2:30AM on a sticky note beside my bed."
177,"A man emerges from the desert after an absence of four years. His brother finds him and together they return to Los Angeles, reuniting the man with his young son. Shortly thereafter, he and the boy set out to search for the child's mother, who had disappeared soon after the man's departure.
10/10"
178,"I for some reason thought that Movie would be about France and Usa, but it turned out to be completely different movie. I just loved everything about this movie, it was so chilling to watch, felt so real and emotional. I love the Lightings, I've felt the 80s atmosphere. Texas feels empty, big and somehow very relaxing."
179,"Desert scenes in beginning of film are interesting but there are so many outrageous and coincidental incidents throughout the story. For example, Travis and boy Hunter go on a trip to a Houston bank (from a Los Angeles ""suburb"") to find their once wife/mother who had left them years earlier. The details are just as ridiculous. The title ""Paris, Texas"" enters into the film but the reasoning is forced. Too many improbabilities and unexplained situations. Two stars for the camera work which is most impressive. The remaining minus eight because of the tedium and relentless boredom of the acting and story."
180,"""This society eliminates geographical distance only to produce a new internal separation."" - Guy DebordWim Wenders has long been an admirer of Michelangelo Antonioni. In 1994 he assisted the Italian director in the production of ""Beyond the Clouds"", and five years later would write ""My Time With Antonioni"", a diary of his extraordinary experiences working on the film.Wenders is also a huge Nicholas Ray fan. In 1980 he made ""Lighting Over Water"", a documentary about the last days of director Nicholas Ray.It should be no surprise, then, that Wenders' ""Paris, Texas"" is so strongly indebted to both directors. Part Antonioni's ""The Passenger"" and part Ray's ""In A Lonely Place"", the film is also another in a long line of Wim Wenders road movies.Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis, an elderly man who has spent the past 4 years wandering in the wilderness. Like Jack Nicholson in Antonioni's ""The Passenger"", Travis is trying to escape his past. He wishes to return to his place of conception, paradoxically a point of non-existence and a point of birth. Travis does not only want to eradicate himself, he wishes to restart. To be reborn.Most of ""Paris, Texas"" consists of Travis navigating vast empty spaces. Like Antonioni, Wenders favours vacant expanses, his characters sliding across their fabricated landscapes, dwarfed by concrete indifference. Wenders also makes gorgeous use of neon lights, and consults his many photo albums when choosing his shooting locations (Wenders is an exhibited photographer, and often travels the world photographing buildings, landscapes and people). This lends the film a unique look: a travelogue of alienation.With its designer existentialism, ""Paris, Texas"" covers the same thematic areas as Antonioni. But where the Italian director is cold and sterile, Wenders - a Christian - is filled with a fiery sort of humanity. Maybe he got this from Ray, who could be remarkably warm even at darkest moments. Wenders makes a mistake than Antonioni never made, however, and spends the entire final act of his film explaining what led to Travis disappearing for four years. It turns out that Travis married a young woman and had a son with her. Life was happy and carefree, until disillusionment, jealousy and a sort of existential nausea crept into their relationship. This led to the couple breaking apart. She, in typical Antonioni fashion, turned to empty sex with strangers in an attempt to distract her from her problems, placating her dissatisfactions with brief moments of biochemical pleasure. He simply disappeared into the wilderness.By focusing on domestic issues - the problems of raising a son, sex, youth, family, disillusionment, alienation, and shattered relationships ‚Äì Wenders manages to lessen the film's overall effect. The film turns into a ""marital problem"", the result of a couple falling out, rather than the more elusive, unspeakably cosmic dilemmas that Antonioni manages to convey. Still, Wenders is great at demonstrating how difficult it is for 2 people to articulate their feelings directly. Toward the end of his film his couple have an extended conversation, Wenders separating them by screens and telephones, husband and wife unable to face one another directly. It's a great scene.8.5/10 ‚Äì With ""The Wrong Move"", ""Paris, Texas"", ""Alice in the Cities"", ""The State of Things"", ""Until The End Of The World"", and ""King of the Roads"", Wenders has established himself as the master of road movies. ""Paris, Texas"" isn't as great as some of these films, but it's perhaps his most straight forward, his most accessible, hence its popularity.Note: This film is the reason David Lynch cast Harry Dean Stanton in his own road movie, ""The Straight Story"". Both revolving around two brothers, you might say these two films tell the same story from different points of view."
181,"Slowly, but steadily told story about a broken family and a tragic love. Great road movie with picturesque shots and intriguing music. Excellent acting, by both young and adult protagonists. Wonderful finale with touching dialogue spoken through a one-way mirror and a phone. Very artistic and impressive."
182,"The match of desert images in the first minutes and the Ry Cooder soundtrack make a lasting impression.  Indeed the cinematography is stunning throughout and makes this movie a must-see.  The eventual storyline as revealed is a little unconvincing, perhaps because of the casting, but it's moving nonetheless. Overall this is one of my top five all-time favourites."
183,"Paris, Texas, is one of Wim Wender's best films and was similar to Cormac's novel. It depicted America from the view of people who are not from America; I'm sure the Foreign story about America is the finest. I know this movie is the second Wim Wender film I have watched, and I say that Paris, Texas is one of his masterpieces. A Mixture between Family Dramas and Road Movies is the finest, and this movie made Wim Wender gain a Golden Plame from the Cannes film festival. I love these movies-one of the finest Non-American films set in the USA that I have ever watched and I love it of all, all times."
184,"2021 and only just watched this cinematic treasure for the first time!A wonderfully shot methodical slow paced dissection of lost love and lives going off at different tangents!You just can't fail to be moved by this movie, absolutely one not to be missed and so glad I caught up with it after all these years !Could be released now and would win Oscar's!"
185,"This movie is horrible! I watched and watched and nothing really happens. There were so many ""artistic"" scenes where nothing happened I almost fell asleep. If you do watch this, have your thumb ready to go on the fast forward button. There's plenty of fluff to skip over. Very poorly directed movie."
186,"It is interesting that none of this movie was filmed in Paris, Texas, that quaint little town about 100 miles NE of Dallas, with the replica of the Eiffel Tower in its town square. All we see is a photo of a vacant lot, which looks nothing like the area Paris actually is in.Harry Dean Stanton, already 50-ish, is remarkable as Travis, who is aimlessly marching through a desert as the movie opens. Ragged, dirty, and hungry, he makes it to a small store where he collapses after one bite of crushed ice. The local doctor revives him, and somehow finds a way to contact Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who through some difficulty retrieves him and brings him to California.Travis is initially mute, unable to explain what had caused him to disappear for 4 years, or even to know that he had been gone for that long. ""Four years, is that a long time?"" In that time his young wife had disappeared, leaving their young son Hunter (Hunter Carson) to be raised by Walt and his wife.This movie is long, has very little to no action, and will be boring to many. I was not bored. I was absorbed in this character Travis, and where he was going to re-claim his life. A good chunk of the second half of the movie was filmed in Houston, where I live and worked, and many of the downtown buildings and highways felt as if I was right there, watching them through a window. The cinematography is superb.SPOILERS: As Travis regains his reasoning, and gets to know his son, he decides to find his wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski as a Texan) after he gets a clue that every month on the 5th she deposits money in an account for her son at a bank in Houston. Hunter insists on going with Travis, and together they find Jane, working in a sex business where she and other girls role-play in booths where patrons see them through windows, and they have no contact with the patrons, can't even see them through the mirrored glass. Travis leaves Hunter in the hotel room, visits Jane as a patron, tells her the whole story, and watches from the top of a parking garage as he sees, through the hotel window, the reunion of Hunter and Jane. His mission is accomplished, he knows he can't be with Jane, but he has made it possible for his son to have his mother."
187,"We all have events in our past that we wish we had never experienced. We avoid talking about them. It is difficult to admit mistakes. Sometimes we cannot look the other person in the eye when we make this confession. It is easier to turn away. But does that fix our mistakes? ""Paris, Texas"" will shake you to your core. As a director, I didn't see a great success. The script picks up towards the end of the movie. The acting is above standard. A more successful performance of the small actress could have made the movie more watchable. In this movie we watch the story of a man who misses his chance to have a ""family"". But we only ""watch"". I can't say that I could get into the movie."
188,"A man seemingly inexplicably has been wandering the desert in Texas for the past 4 years. He is finally found by his brother and takes him into his home. From that point, the man goes on a mission to confront his past and heal the wounds that lead him to become a wanderer.Paris, Texas is a slow moving character study about a psychologically wounded man. If you aren't already conditioned by Hollywood to crave non-stop action with sub-par scripts, and can enjoy a character study that takes its time to unfold the story, then this movie can be a real treat for you. Like most movies that I really enjoy, the cinematography and direction are great, and it really makes me care about the main character and hope for him to get everything worked out. The ending, which I won't spoil, is cinema at it's best, and leaves you both sad and happy at the same time. In my opinion, easily one of the best movies of the 80's."
189,"I can't really find the words to describe the feelings I got. It's just one of the best films I have ever watched. Story, aesthetics, soundtrack, acting, everything. Every color is a feeling, oh my God. I'm literally crying."
190,"I have seen this movie many times and its emotional impact never fades.In fact when I first saw it many years ago it completely blew me away. Wim Wenders is a master director.The central performances are first rate and the heart rending finale is handled with care and totally without any trace of slushy sentimentality. A story of a man who has lost everything including his wife and young son who makes the journey both physically and symbolically in his quest for redemption. There is one scene in the second meeting between Travis and Jane where the scene shifts from Travis to Jane that although subtle has huge dramatic impact.He can see her, she can only hear him through the telephone,something he says, she recognises.That flash of recognition with the change of perspective creates a sublime moment of drama. If you have no other reason for seeing this movie than watch it for Nastassja Kinski.The first time we really see her as she turns slowly from the bar is a moment of beauty.An iconic image of female perfection Go see you will be rewarded."
191,"I went to see this film when it came out. Even so many decades on it is still there at number 1 as the worst film I have ever seen. I has no redeeming features. It is too long It has no story - honestly. It is poorly shot. The music is annoying making it impossibly to even sleep through it. The acting is abysmal. There was, I seem to remember, some gratuitous nudity as well. A waste of film-stock. What makes it even worse is that it is not just crap, but pretentious crap. I am have been waiting for it to appear on television just to confirm my suspicions, but I guess the advertiser would not touch it with a 10 foot pole. Usually even bad films have some redeeming features, but this film does not."
192,"A beautiful, well-made movie.  Too bad it is only 20 minutes of storyline stretched out to movie length.Man helps brother end his mindless wandering.  Brother stays with man and slowly acts less weird.  Brother meets his son who is staying with man and wife and being brought up as their son.  Family refamiliarisation ensues and storyline progresses.  All with a backdrop of North American countryside, cities and towns - mostly dreary dusty looking places.I like movies in this style because they show what todays movies lack, this one however was missing something else that would have made it a joy to watch by keeping of your attention.  I would only recommend it to watch in the background while you do something to occupy the rest of your attention."
193,"I couldn't forget the scene that Travis and Jane r warching each other yet there's this mirror between them. They r so close to each other, yet they can never be together again. Love will tear us apart."
194,"Compelling story about the reunion of mother and little son. It tells about the emptiness of life. It tells about love, lonliness, compassion, missing, distance. I've seen it several times. Incredibly good actors, beautiful landscapes. Nastassja kinsky is extremly attractive. The boy acts great!"
195,"I find the scene where Travis talks with Jane through the one way mirror, very powerful and emotional. The dialogue is slow, tense, and the scene full of dramatic irony. The closest the two can get is hands separated by glass, as Travis negotiates his son back to his wife. Ry Cooder's stark spare music matches the whole beautiful painful film.One of my favourite films - and free too with the Sunday Times - a miracle! I saw this when it first came out, yet I could remember nearly every scene, and had a spooky experience on the 395 on the way to a skiing holiday sitting in the diner,which features early in the film! Slow, powerful film - stick with it - it will stick with you!"
196,"This was a magical experience. This movie warmed my heart with a following freezing side effect. The fact that it isn't trying to portray an aimless man who almost lost his everything makes it even more miserable. You can say this film is anti-romance but no one can say it isn't about love. Love and letting go of love because of love. I think everyone can find a piece for themselves in this one. This for everyone without doubt. That scene -you know which one- was like an openhearted excuse and really deep. They're faces blending each other, the emotinal impact is calculated very well. Also Travis and Hunter running across the road on opposite directions was really heart-warming. I ADORED them as a deficient father&son. Amazing work of Wenders is just speak for it self. A remarkable film that always gonna stay with me. Probably in top 10 in my favorite films for now."
197,"""Paris, Texas"" is a tender insight of what it means to be a father. And what it means to fall in love. The Mise-En-Sc√®ne is subtle but works very effectively. This film is very character and story based. The character development is great. The performances are magical and touching. Some scenes are very drawn out, but captivating. One very pivotal scene in particular which offers a slow burn and an extraordinary pay off demonstrates this tremendously.It is particularly emotional, with some marvellous, intimate, glistening moments which leaves a bitter sweet sensation. If the first 40 minutes doesn't grab you, I encourage you to persist. All in all, ""Paris Texas"" is a thought provoking, independent film, that's worth your while."
198,"This is a unique and ponderous tale of a wanderer (Harry Dean Stanton), who has lost his lover (Natassja Kinski), their child (Hunter Carson) and his reason and then is patiently returned to society by his loving brother (Dean Stockwell) and sister-in-law (Aurore Clement). It will alienate many viewers who expect the faster pace of nearly all movies and TV shows. Moreover, the main character is a very flawed person, not a hero in any conventional way, although he exhibits some growth. Sam Shepard was a writer/actor of immense talent and Wim Wenders gives the actors all the time and space they need. Ry Cooder's score is adept."
199,"This film starts off slow, with a rather ill-defined plot centred around a disheveled man stumbling around the desert who is picked up by his brother. Like the brother, we find ourselves quickly frustrated by the mystery surrounding the man's past, but it eventually gets revealed when he integrates into society again. The subtle friction he causes with his son and brother accentuates just how out of touch he is. The acting of this depiction is superb - there is little overt melodrama and it is all quite subtle, a sense of discomfort that yearns to be resolved. This resolution comes in the form of an almost therapeutic third act where the mother finally returns to the picture, asking just how much we deserve redemption. The ending is truly touching but does raise questions of just how far we can offer forgiveness and whether we are actually better off leaving the past in the past."
200,"The basic story of the film is nothing out of the ordinary, but it's what the filmmaker does with it that's pretty amazing. The cinematography is so simplistic yet so difficult to recreate. It's a slow burn movie, but the ending is so rewarding to watch. It's pretty difficult to explain what makes this film so good. I don't know how but at the end of the film you're just left sitting there just thinking. Trust me, it's great, I WOULD RECOMMEND this movie, just watch it, it's great."
201,"Texas is a desolate but beautiful and enchanted land and that certainly shows in this film. One is reminded to some extent of other films set in Texas, such as ""Blood Simple"" or ""The Last Picture Show."" Characters are silent and almost stoical, like the cowboys of the old days. It is almost as if the heat just cooks the words out of the mind as one squints in the hot sun.The film opens with the bluesy guitar work of Ry Cooder, which is just right for the desolate scene: the lead character of the movie (Harry Dean Stanton) wanders on foot in the noonday sun through a landscape that is a bit like the biblical wilderness of Jesus, the Big Bend region near the Rio Grande. The man seems to have lost his mind, or his way, or both. He collapses on the floor of a local bar and he is finally taken into protective custody. His brother, (Dean Stockwell) who works in outdoor advertising in Los Angeles, is summoned to fetch him. The brother talks, and Stanton only talks after a long while. It turns out he has a seven year old son, Hunter, who has been adopted by his Uncle and his aunt.The rest of the story recounts how he comes to terms with the traumatic breakup of his marriage and how he reconnects with his young son. This could easily have become a sticky sweet mess, but it is a tribute to the storytelling skill of director Wim Wenders and screenwriters L. M. Kit Carson and Sam Shepherd that this does not happen. Throughout the film, and in the performance of Nastassia Kinski as the estranged mother and wife, it has the ring of truth and a hopeful if not entirely happy ending."
202,"The opening desert sequence should strike a chord with anyone who's had a lost period or remains adrift. The soundtrack both reflects and generates the mood of the film. Ry Cooder created an acoustic guitar masterpiece that really speaks of the American desert and tragic lives.I enjoyed this movie the most before we really began to learn the story behind Travis' disappearance. The early road sequences were done with great atmosphere and poignancy. The ending seemed somewhat mundane compared to the mystery preceding it, though that's often the case. I just would have left more open to interpretation. Stanton and Kinski made an odd couple but these are minor points in a classic film."
203,"I mean, it was good, there are a lot of memorable sequences, a very good dialogues, but to me it seems kinda empty.The actors were there, of course they were talking but there wasn¬¥t too much, it seems vere pretencious to be a film with more than 2 hours, there are a lot of scenes that could have been shorters, it was just too long, i never feel conected.And there a good things to say about the director, the use of the colors on the film were too good, i¬¥m not saying is bad but i really feel it was too long and kinda boring.Duraci√≥n: 2/5

204,"We first join Travis in the middle of the desert, not remembering who he is or why he's there. Some personal documents are found on him, his brother is called to pick him up, and we spend the next half hour watching him refuse to talk as they drive about the desert. The acting was bad, the dialogue bad, and the intrigue not enough to sustain the monotony, so that was enough for me. I fast forwarded to the end and their did appear to be some engaging scenes between Travis and his ex-wife, now a sex worker, but it was too little too late."
205,This film wanders around with little to say like the main character. I was never compelled to watch this movie for 37 years and I hate to admit watching this film felt like it lasted 37 years.
206,"Great. My first review. It's too bad I start with Paris, Texas because I have only one word for it: BORING. I watched a few hours earlier Coen's The Man Who Wasn't There. So, with a very good state of mind, I got to watch Paris, Texas, mostly because of the good reviews. The beginning was good: nice frames, clean and wide views in the country and a mysterious man with no past. I thought that should be watchable. I was mistaken. After an hour I had to go to sleep. I thought I was tired, but it was the movie. I didn't like Travis at all. No intellect. I see people like him everyday and they're no surprise. His kid is even smarter than him. If the intention was to see a simple man's life with his simple man's decisions then the film makers succeeded. But I think this recipe is for 5 year old's. Luckily there is a Forward button and I watched the predictable ending. 5 is merely for cinematography and a few good melodramatic scenes."
207,"I first decided not to watch this movie but a friend recommended me it so I gave it a try. And I have to say that it is not the worst movie I saw this week! The story is nice and kind, even a bit heartwarming at the end. Acting is solid, music is great. All in all it is a very solid movie you can watch if you like the setting US in the 1980s. However sometimes it is a bit long and you have to be patient but that is not a big problem. The movie is clearly overrated but as I already sad absolutely solid and watchable.Try it if you have the chance to watch it but do not expect a masterpiece of it."
208,"The movie starts off well, posing the question ""what tragedy was so serious it could not even be spoken"", and as the movie continues there are more and more hints revealed that every single character in the movie has the maturity of a child, and finally the tragedy is given words in its entirety, of which it confirms the entire movie was founded on every character being adult children; not facing anything at all that justified any of the tragedy, only their own immaturity which continues to perpetuate the tragedy even more into the future for no reason beyond arthouse tropes for arthouse accolades. If you want a movie where tragedy occurs to adults and not just adult-children then this is not the movie for you. Go watch eyes wide shut, or any lars von trier, gaspar noe, or sion sono movie which have similar feels. This movie is merely a suburban western; where woman can do no wrong, man is to blame for everything, redemption is the man coming from then returning back to the wilderness rather than ever claiming a seat in adulthood. Dream on teenagers and adult children, mature up."
209,"Horrible movie...no action, no plot, no purpose, no ending....don't bother! Waited and waited for something to happen.....It never did! We'll never get this time back!"
210,"Very long-winded and pointless. The opening scene is fascinating enough, because the overdressed tramp quick-marching out of the desert raises a lot of questions. From here on, unfortunately, things deteriorate rapidly. He ends up in a local hospital, fine, but why has it to be a greedy kraut doctor? Next: a road movie somewhat like Rainman (1988, four years later and much better). Next: back to normal life. Next: finding his wife. The whole story of the couple (which is not very exciting in itself) is told by the main character through a telephone while his wife is listening. Boredom supreme! It's bad enough when a stage play is turned into a static movie, but this beats everything. We had as well read it, instead of having to listen to this long long long story. I gave 3/10 for the nice pictures: a desert view here, a bright blue wall there, a giant dinosaur somewhere else etcetera. As a ""movie"" (as in ""moving"") it's worthless."
211,One of the worst movies i've ever seen. Nothing really happens ever.
212,"Can you say editing? This movie could've been 30 minutes shorter (and better) if they edited out all of the silence and static. It was a pretty bad movie. It had potential, but it took forever for most scenes to develop. I almost feel like someone could narrate the story in 3 minutes, and you'd get the entire plot and feel of this movie. Heaven's Gate was better than this."
213,"From the opening scene of Harry Dean Stanton wandering out of the gorgeous Mojave Desert right up to the point where he starts talking, I thought I was seeing something special. Stanton was doing more with his facial expressions than most actors can do shouting a hundred lines of dialogue.
Dean Stockwell and Aurore Clement do most of the talking in the early going and they do very well in their roles. I thought their characters were very realistically drawn.
Unfortunately, there's a kid. He's 7 but as savvy as a 17 year old. He's just not at all believable as an actual 7 year old. And then the road trip, wherein Stanton's character talks as much as any celebrity on Oprah's couch. By the time we get to the scenes where Stanton is speaking through the glass partition I was getting restless. Yet it got worse. What started practically as a silent movie turned into a morose, Bergman-like gabfest. Could have been at least a half-hour shorter and accomplished the same thing, which, come to think of it, was nothing anyway.
No wonder this joker turned to directing U2 videos. He fits Bono's sense of self-importance."
214,"This movie has nothing to do with my actual home town. When I was around 17 I was really excited to watch it. Then I was very disappointed it had nothing to do with the actual Paris, Texas I've grew up in. That small town is nuts. I saw more crazy stuff in 3 years than most people see their entire lives. I also became a film maker by age 18. I'm 33 now and my dream is to make my first feature about growing up in Paris, Texas in the early 2000s. Skateboarding. Friendship. Love. Death. Insane fun. My only goal is to make a classic. ""Paris/TX"" Coming Eventually... Peace."
215,"This is a very slow and (somewhat) dull movie; it's quite clear this guy Wimp belongs to the Antonioni-film-school or something. However, the plot was intriguing and at times moving. I really just saw it for Natacha Kinski in her prime. The scene at the phone booth between her and Stanton is very intense and had me at the edge of my seat. The ending is just one of the saddest i've seen...i was hoping that he (well, the 3 of them) would reunite again and start all over, but he just remains as a wanderer and a loner....(5/10)"
216,"First, let me list the redeeming qualities of Paris, Texas 1984.
None
Ok, Now, what made it soooo... bad?
Was it just the phony BS writing by Sam Shepard? I've never read Sam but he has been a favorite of the Avant guard, intellectuals for years.
Was it poor Direction? No, Wem Wenders has made some wonderful films.
Was it the Acting? No, I've always liked Harry Dean Stanton, and Dean Stockwell. Nastassja Kinski is eye candy of the highest order who I've always loved her.Must be Sam for meaningless writing, kinda of like a teen age boy giving us his stream of consciousness.
The remaining question is Why do the intellectual libs fall for it? I'll never understand. They gave it 8.1. Unbelievable. What's with Criterion?"
217,I found this movie on the list of top 1000 movies ever made. I have watched top 100 so far and all these films are from the oldest of times and from anywhere on this earth. I wanted to watch this film for a long time and I felt cheated after watching it.Long and slow movie but I loved the pace. I love drama films and it was going great. Acting Is perfect. Soundtrack sits well with the scenery. Editing and directing is on point. Plot is my problem. It didn't need that twist in the end. Not sure why the writers put it there. I don't rate movies differently if they end on a happy note or a sad note.Watch it for the beautiful cinematography and that's about it.
218,"Classic example of how a director can misportray and incorrectly convey an area. I have lived in Paris, Texas most of my life and can tell you that is a lush piney woods area city of 30,000 and highly urbanized (WalMart, McDonald's, Applebee's, Wendy's, etc.). Tourists from Europe and even Minnesota come in my bookstore shocked at what they've seen because prior to visiting Paris, Texas they thought it was a dessert area because of how it was misrepresented in the movie. Suggest anyone who hasn't visited Paris, Texas skip this atrocious movie and search driving around Paris, Texas videos on YouTube and Rumble."
219,"Excellent movie. Have it on WS laserdisc. Harry Dean Stanton, as usual, is thoroughly convincing in his part. Story line is quite compelling, and when he sits in viewing booth relating story of abuse and neglect of his long lost wife, to his wife, I think it is one of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen in a film. Highly recommended......."
220,"This is exactly my sort of small film. Its minimalist in all but length. The cast is small, the story is small, and the stakes are small. Even the tragedies are small, affecting only one or two people negatively and not at all in a permanent way. All things that would normally leave a movie with its thumb out looking for viewers to pick it up.However, I'm going to judge ""Paris,Texas"" on a different metric because the emotional movements of the heart along its path is is one of the best I have seen in a film for quite some time.It doesn't leave me feeling excited to tell my friends about it. It doesn't make me want to go home and re-watch it that night (as did ""Mishima""). It makes me want to really know myself and be."
221,"""Paris, Texas"" is one of my favorite films of all times, and the thing about this pick is that I can't say with certainty why. The movie starts very empty, showing us a Travis that has isolated himself for some unknown reason. Once you know why (or once you think you know) it still becomes mysterious by leaving gaps in the story. The film is all about unexplainable details, but that's its core: expressing that feeling. There is some romance in his loose actitude, and the soundtrack as well as the visuals help to highlight the lonelyness. Finally it reaches a climax, except that it becomes a monologue rather than a dialogue, the picture is still uncomplete, until he adquieres the braveness to say it out loud; suddenly everything makes sense, and all the things untold in the dialogue becomes clear with the shots and expressions of the two protagonists: it's a love story through pictures rather than words and it does what cinema does (or should attempt to do) best: capture a living feeling, a sensation; the sensation of that inconclusive relationship. It's not a happy ending, but it's definetely not a sad one. It's a bittersweet life."
222,"Harry Dean Stanton in the lead role, and does fine work, at first, portraying a man with amnesia; and then unhappy with the time lost. Nastassja Kinski has the least screen time of the five leads. Every minute she is on screen is fun. Hunter Carson gives a good perfomance. The climax is haunting and potent. Wenders shows his talent with both the execution and the implications of it, and a very satisfying movie."
223,"Paris Texas is my favorite movie, after the first 10 minutes of focusing my eyes on the desert land...I knew I was in for a moving expierience.  I highly recommend this film to everyone."
224,"I first saw this movie over ten years ago and it has long been one of my favorites. A combination of stunning photography and an incredible performance by Harry Dean Stanton (who is rarely offscreen but doesn't speak until about a half hour into the film) brings us a portrait of loss and loneliness with an impact rarely seen in any art form. Without being pretentious, formulaic or self-consciously ""arty"", this film manages to bring more genuine human emotion to the screen than a half-a-dozen ""normal"" movies. Do not miss this one."
225,"If cinematographer Robby Muller's fantastic view of the desert and of L.A. isn't enough to make you love this movie, the story will bowl you over.  So much is said through silence and Shepard and Carson chose the dialogue carefully.  This is a movie of lost people who struggle to find connections. Harry Dean Stanton delivers another just fabulous performance, and does a great impersonation of a ""rich father"".  Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Ry Cooder's soundtrack that perfectly matches the desperation, loss and joy in the film. Whatever happened to Hunter Carson, who plays the little boy in the film? Perhaps his father, writer Carson, dissuaded his son against an acting career, but Hunter breaks your heart in this movie and can really act.  Only a few child actors really have that ability, and then it's usually the directors or editors that pull the performance out of them.  I'd put Hunter up against Henry Thomas in E.T., Lukas Haas in Witness, and Anna Paquin in The Piano anyday."
